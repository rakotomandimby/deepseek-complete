# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

The suggestion is triggered each time the user type the space key.

When the user types fast, the suggestion is triggered multiple times in parallell (because it is asynchronous)
and the response from the DeepSeek API is not even received when the user requests a new suggestion.

I want to silently abort HTTP call to the API
- If the plugin is still waiting for a response from the API.
- If API response has been received within the last 500 milliseconds.

Propose me the changes I need to make to the code in order to achieve that.

--   vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", key, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>" .. key, { noremap = true, silent = true })
-- end


```

Key changes:

- **`api_call_in_progress` flag:**  In `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, this flag is used to track whether an API call is currently in progress.
- **`last_api_call_time` variable:** This variable stores the timestamp of the last API call.
- **Rate limiting logic:** The `suggest()` function now checks these variables before making an API call. If a call is in progress or a call was made within the last 500ms, the function returns early.
- **Resetting the flag:** The `api_call_in_progress` flag is reset to `false` in the callback function of the `curl.post` request, after the response is received. This allows for subsequent API calls to be made.
- **Timestamp in milliseconds:** The `vim.loop.hrtime()` function returns time in nanoseconds. We divide by 1,000,000 to get milliseconds, which is more convenient for our rate limiting logic.


This implementation ensures that only one API call is in progress at a time and that calls are not made too frequently, even if the user types very quickly.  The punctuation key mappings are commented out; uncomment and customize them as needed.
