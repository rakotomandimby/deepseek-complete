# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.

The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I want to create the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.
Give me the code for this function. Just the function not the entire file.








# This is gpt-4o-mini answer (2k in, 0k out)

Here is the code for the `M.get_text_after_cursor()` function that you can add to your `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` file:

```lua
function M.get_text_after_cursor()
  local current_line, current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local lines = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(0, current_line - 1, -1, false)
  lines[1] = string.sub(lines[1], current_col + 1)  -- Get text from the cursor position in the current line
  return table.concat(lines, "\n")
end
```

This function retrieves the text from the cursor position to the end of the current buffer.
