## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

Note: I want to implement the same accept word as Gihub Copilot and Supermaven Neovim plugins. 

When a suggestion is displayed as extmark, I want that if I press `<M-Right>` key,
the first word of the suggestion transformes into text at the same position.

The space between the current cusor position and the first word of the suggestion must be preserved, if any.

Givi me the code of the `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function that implements this behavior.

To implement the `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function, you need to extract the first word from the current suggestion, insert it into the buffer at the current cursor position, and then update the suggestion to remove the accepted word. Here's how you can achieve this:

```lua
function M.accept_suggestion_word()
  if not _G.current_suggestion or _G.current_suggestion == "" then
    return
  end

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
  local col = position[2]

  -- Find the first word in the suggestion
  local first_word, rest_of_suggestion = _G.current_suggestion:match("^(%%S+)(.*)")

  if not first_word then
    return
  end

  -- Insert the first word at the current cursor position
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(current_buf, row, col, row, col, { first_word })

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the inserted word
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + 1, col + #first_word })

  -- Update the current suggestion to remove the accepted word
  _G.current_suggestion = rest_of_suggestion:match("^%%s*(.*)")

  -- Clear the current extmark and set a new one with the updated suggestion
  M.clear_suggestion()
  if _G.current_suggestion and _G.current_suggestion ~= "" then
    M.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
  end
end
```

### Explanation:

1. **Check for Existing Suggestion**: The function first checks if there is a current suggestion. If not, it simply returns.

2. **Extract the First Word**: It uses pattern matching to extract the first word from the suggestion. The pattern `^(%%S+)(.*)` captures the first word and the rest of the suggestion separately.

3. **Insert the Word**: The first word is inserted at the current cursor position using `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text`.

4. **Update Cursor Position**: The cursor is moved to the end of the inserted word.

5. **Update Suggestion**: The current suggestion is updated to remove the accepted word, and any leading spaces are trimmed.

6. **Update Extmark**: The existing extmark is cleared, and a new one is set with the updated suggestion if there is any remaining text.

This implementation should mimic the behavior of accepting suggestions word by word, similar to GitHub Copilot and other similar plugins.
