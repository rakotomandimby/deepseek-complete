# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

I wrote `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

But when I type `<M-PageDown>`, the inline suggestion appears as just one line with a `^@` in the place of the newline character.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion display on multiple lines and push down the lines below.

The issue lies in how you're handling newlines within the virtual text chunks.  `^@` is the representation of the raw newline character (0x0A).  Virtual text needs special handling for newlines to render them correctly.  You're correctly inserting `\n` but not as a separate chunk with its own highlighting.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  -- 1. Move cursor to the end of the line *FIRST*  (This is correct and important)
  local current_row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_row, #current_line + 1}) -- +1 to move past end of line


  local sentence = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local lines = vim.split(sentence, "\n", true)

  -- Log the lines (for debugging)
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Lines:")
  for _, line in ipairs(lines) do
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(line)
  end
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("")

  -- Use virtual text for multi-line suggestions.  Crucially, use \n as the actual newline
  local chunks = {}
  for i, line in ipairs(lines) do
    table.insert(chunks, { line, "Comment" })  -- Use "Comment" highlight group for grey

    -- Add a newline chunk *after* each line except the last
    if i < #lines then
      table.insert(chunks, { "\n", "Comment" }) -- Newline with "Comment" highlighting
    end
  end


  local current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[2] -- Get updated column

  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_row - 1, current_col, { virt_text = chunks, virt_text_pos = 'overlay' })

  -- Clear the suggestion on TextChangedI (unchanged)
  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", { clear = true })
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
    group = augroup_id,
    buffer = 0,
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id)
    end,
  })
end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
  end,
})

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageDown>", "<Cmd>lua suggest_random_sentence()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

Key Change:  The newline character `\n` is now added as a separate chunk with the "Comment" highlight.  This tells Neovim to render it as a proper newline in the virtual text display, pushing subsequent lines down correctly.  The grey color (#808080) is achieved by using the "Comment" highlight group.



Now, when you press `<M-PageDown>` in insert mode, the multi-line suggestions should appear correctly, pushing the content below down and displaying in grey.  Typing any character will clear the suggestion.
