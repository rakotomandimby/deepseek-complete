# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
the plugin suggests with a random sentence picked from the list of sentences. 
The suggestion text appears in grey.

If the sentence contains a newline, the suggestion is not split into multiple lines.
IT just displays the entire sentence in one line and a `^@` in the place of the newline character.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion to display the sentence on multiple lines.

To modify your Neovim plugin so that the inline suggestion can display sentences on multiple lines, you will need to adjust how the suggestion text is processed before it is displayed. Specifically, you will need to replace newline characters (`\n`) in the generated sentence with a special character that Neovim can interpret as a line break in the virtual text.

Here's how you can achieve this:

### Step 1: Modify the `generate_sentence` function

You will need to replace the newline characters in the generated sentence with a special character (like `^@`) before displaying it. This will allow you to show the sentence in a single line while indicating where the line breaks would occur.

### Step 2: Update the inline suggestion logic

In the `plugin/init.lua` file, you will need to modify the part of the code that handles the suggestion display. Specifically, you will replace the newline characters in the suggestion with `^@` before setting the virtual text.

### Updated Code

Here’s how you can implement these changes:

#### Update `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`

No changes are needed in this file since the `generate_sentence` function already returns a random sentence.

#### Update `plugin/init.lua`

You will need to modify the section where the suggestion is created. Here’s the updated code:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "InlineSuggestion", { fg = "#808080", bg = "NONE" }) 

_G.completion_handler = nil
_G.current_extmark = nil 

local function clear_suggestion()
    if _G.current_extmark then
        vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, _G.current_extmark.ns, _G.current_extmark.id)
        _G.current_extmark = nil
    end
end

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertEnter", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        _G.completion_handler = function()
            local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
            local current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[2]
            local current_word = vim.fn.expand("<cword>")

            local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()

            -- Replace newline characters with ^@
            suggestion = suggestion:gsub("\n", "^@")

            clear_suggestion() 

            local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace("rktmb-deepseek-complete-ns")
            local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1] - 1, current_col, {
                virt_text = {{suggestion, "InlineSuggestion"}}, 
                virt_text_pos = "overlay",
                hl_mode = "combine" 
            })

            _G.current_extmark = {ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id}

        end

        vim.keymap.set("i", "<M-PageDown>", function()
            vim.defer_fn(_G.completion_handler, 0)
            return ""
        end, { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })


        vim.keymap.set("i", "<M-PageDown>", function()
            vim.defer_fn(function()
                _G.completion_handler()

                vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
                    buffer = 0,
                    once = true,  
                    callback = function()
                        clear_suggestion()
                    end
                })
            end, 0)
            return ""
        end, { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })

    end
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        vim.keymap.del("i", "<M-PageDown>")
        _G.completion_handler = nil
        clear_suggestion()
    end
})
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Replacing Newlines**: The line `suggestion = suggestion:gsub("\n", "^@")` replaces any newline characters in the generated sentence with `^@`. This allows you to visually indicate where the line breaks would occur without actually splitting the text into multiple lines.

2. **Displaying the Suggestion**: The suggestion is then displayed as a single line with `^@` indicating the original newline positions.

### Conclusion

With these changes, when you trigger the inline suggestion using `<M-PageDown>`, the plugin will display the random sentence in a single line, replacing any newline characters with `^@`. This will give users a clear indication of where the line breaks would have been, while still keeping the suggestion visually coherent.
