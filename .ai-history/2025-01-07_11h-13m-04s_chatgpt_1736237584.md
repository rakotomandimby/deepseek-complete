# Accept the first line of the suggestion and triger again

There is a keymap and a function to accept the whole suggestion: `_G.accept_the_whole_suggestion`.

I want to accept the first line of the suggestion with a keymap `<M-Down>`.
I also want that when I accept the first line, the remaining suggestions lines are discarded and another suggestion is triggered based on that accepted line.

Tell me what I need to change in the code to achieve what I want.

To achieve your desired functionality, you'll need to modify the `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line` function in your `plugin/init.lua` file. The changes involve:

1. **Accepting the first line of the suggestion.**
2. **Discarding the remaining suggestion lines.**
3. **Triggering a new suggestion based on the accepted line.**

Here's how you can implement these changes:

---

### **Step 1: Modify the `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line` Function**

Update the function to accept the first line, discard the remaining lines, clear the current suggestion, and trigger a new suggestion.

**Replace your existing `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line` function with the following:**

```lua
_G.accept_one_suggestion_line = function()
  if not _G.current_extmark_id or not _G.current_suggestion then
    -- No active suggestion to accept
    return
  end

  local bufnr = 0  -- Current buffer
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local current_line = cursor_pos[1]

  -- Get the first line of the suggestion
  local first_suggestion_line = _G.current_suggestion[1]

  -- Insert the first line of the suggestion into the buffer at the current line
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, current_line - 1, current_line - 1, false, { first_suggestion_line })

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the inserted line
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line, #first_suggestion_line })

  -- Clear the current suggestion and extmark
  vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, _G.current_extmark_id)
  _G.current_extmark_id = nil
  _G.current_suggestion = nil

  -- Trigger a new suggestion based on the updated buffer content
  suggest()
end
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Insert the First Line:**
  - The first line of the suggestion (`first_suggestion_line`) is inserted into the buffer at the current cursor position.
  - Adjusted `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines` indices to correctly insert at the current line (`current_line - 1` due to Lua's 1-based indexing).

- **Move the Cursor:**
  - The cursor is moved to the end of the newly inserted line using `vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor`.

- **Discard Remaining Suggestion Lines:**
  - By clearing `_G.current_suggestion`, you effectively discard the remaining lines.
  - The current extmark displaying the suggestion is deleted using `vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark`.

- **Trigger a New Suggestion:**
  - The `suggest()` function is called to generate a new suggestion based on the updated buffer, including the newly accepted line.

---

### **Step 2: Ensure the Keymap is Set Correctly**

You've mentioned that you want to use `<M-Down>` to accept the first line. In your `plugin/init.lua`, the default key mappings are already set as:

```lua
-- Default keymappings
local default_opts = {
  suggest_keymap = "<M-ESC>",
  accept_all_keymap = "<M-PageDown>",
  accept_line_keymap = "<M-Down>",
}
```

And later, the key mappings are applied:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_keymap,     "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>",                     { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_all_keymap,  "<Cmd>lua accept_the_whole_suggestion()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_line_keymap, "<Cmd>lua accept_one_suggestion_line()<CR>",  { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

Since `accept_line_keymap` is set to `<M-Down>`, pressing `<M-Down>` will call the updated `accept_one_suggestion_line` function.

### **Full `plugin/init.lua` with Changes**

For clarity, here is the relevant portion of your `plugin/init.lua` with the updated function:

```lua
-- ... (previous code)

_G.accept_one_suggestion_line = function()
  if not _G.current_extmark_id or not _G.current_suggestion then
    -- No active suggestion to accept
    return
  end

  local bufnr = 0  -- Current buffer
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local current_line = cursor_pos[1]

  -- Get the first line of the suggestion
  local first_suggestion_line = _G.current_suggestion[1]

  -- Insert the first line of the suggestion into the buffer at the current line
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, current_line - 1, current_line - 1, false, { first_suggestion_line })

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the inserted line
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line, #first_suggestion_line })

  -- Clear the current suggestion and extmark
  vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, _G.current_extmark_id)
  _G.current_extmark_id = nil
  _G.current_suggestion = nil

  -- Trigger a new suggestion based on the updated buffer content
  suggest()
end

-- Default keymappings
local default_opts = {
  suggest_keymap = "<M-ESC>",
  accept_all_keymap = "<M-PageDown>",
  accept_line_keymap = "<M-Down>",  -- Ensure this is set correctly
}

-- Read user configuration
local user_opts = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", default_opts, vim.g.rktmb_deepseek_complete_opts or {})

-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_keymap,     "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>",                     { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_all_keymap,  "<Cmd>lua accept_the_whole_suggestion()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_line_keymap, "<Cmd>lua accept_one_suggestion_line()<CR>",  { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- ... (remaining code)
```

### **Additional Notes**

- **Cursor Positioning:**
  - The cursor is moved to the end of the inserted line to ensure that the new suggestion starts from the correct place.

- **Buffer Indices:**
  - Remember that in Lua and Neovim's API, buffer line indices are 0-based, while cursor positions are 1-based. That's why when inserting lines, we use `current_line - 1`.

- **Clearing Suggestions:**
  - Clearing `_G.current_suggestion` and `_G.current_extmark_id` ensures that old suggestions do not interfere with new ones.

- **Triggering the Suggestion:**
  - Calling `suggest()` after accepting the line will generate a new suggestion based on the updated buffer content.

---

### **Testing the Changes**

1. **Save Your Changes:**
   - Make sure to save the modified `plugin/init.lua` file.

2. **Reload Neovim:**
   - Restart Neovim or source your configuration to load the changes.
     ```vim
     :source $MYVIMRC
     ```

3. **Test the Functionality:**
   - Open a file and enter insert mode.
   - Trigger a suggestion using your defined keymap (`<M-ESC>` by default).
   - When the suggestion appears, press `<M-Down>` to accept the first line.
   - Observe that:
     - The first line is inserted into your buffer.
     - The remaining suggestion lines are discarded.
     - A new suggestion is automatically triggered based on the current context.

---

### **Summary**

By making these changes:

- **Accept the First Line with `<M-Down>`:**
  - The first line of the suggestion is inserted into your buffer when you press `<M-Down>`.

- **Discard Remaining Lines:**
  - The rest of the suggestion is discarded to prevent confusion with outdated suggestions.

- **Trigger New Suggestion:**
  - A new suggestion is generated based on the updated buffer content, allowing for iterative code completion.

---

### **Potential Enhancements**

- **Adjust Suggestion Context:**
  - If needed, adjust how the `suggest()` function gathers context to ensure that new suggestions are relevant after each accepted line.

- **User Feedback:**
  - Consider adding visual or audible feedback when a new suggestion is triggered to enhance the user experience.

- **Customization:**
  - Expose additional options in `vim.g.rktmb_deepseek_complete_opts` to allow users to customize behavior, such as automatically triggering suggestions after certain actions.
