# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

The suggestion is triggered each time the user type the space key.
When the user types fast, the suggestion is triggered only if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types, the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
But as far as the user types, the suggestion must be cleared.
If a new suggestion comes, the old suggestion must be cleared.
If the user continues typing, the suggestion must be cleared and the new suggestion will be displayed when it arrives.
This behaviour must be repeatable any time the user types.

The current code implements those behaviors, but it has one problem:
- Changing the text in the buffer will cause the suggestion to be cleared.
- When the suggestion pushes down the existing text, it performs a text change.
- When making the place for himself, the suggestion is cleared.

To avoid that, I want to configure the suggestion clearing not when the text is changed but when the user types a printable character.

Tell me the modifications I need to make the suggestion clearing to happen only when the user types a printable character.

To modify your Neovim plugin to clear suggestions only when the user types a printable character, you will need to adjust the autocommand that currently clears the suggestions on any text change. Instead, you will create a new autocommand that specifically listens for printable character inputs.

Here's how you can implement this:

### Step 1: Modify the `TextChangedI` Autocommand

You will replace the existing `TextChangedI` autocommand with a new one that checks for printable characters. You can use the `vim.fn.getchar()` function to determine if the character typed is printable.

### Step 2: Update the `plugin/init.lua` File

Replace the existing `TextChangedI` autocommand with the following code:

```lua
-- Key mappings for printable characters
local function is_printable_char(char)
  return char >= 32 and char <= 126  -- ASCII printable characters
end

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertCharPre", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    local char = vim.fn.getchar()
    if is_printable_char(char) then
      -- Clear existing extmarks when typing a printable character
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)
    end
  end
})
```

### Full Updated `plugin/init.lua`

Hereâ€™s how your `plugin/init.lua` file should look after the modifications:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

local api_call_in_progress = false
local last_api_call_time = 0

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

-- Default keymappings
local default_opts = {
  deepseek_api_key = os.getenv("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"),
  suggest_lines_keymap = "<M-ESC>",
  accept_all_keymap = "<M-PageDown>",
  accept_line_keymap = "<M-Down>",
  debounce_time = 1000,
}

-- Read user configuration
local user_opts = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", default_opts, vim.g.rktmb_deepseek_complete_opts or {})

local function process_deepseek_response(response)
  vim.schedule(function()  -- Use vim.schedule to run this in the main thread
    local response_body = vim.fn.json_decode(response.body)
    if response_body.choices and #response_body.choices > 0 then
      local choice = response_body.choices[1]
      local suggestion = choice.message.content
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
      _G.current_suggestion = suggestion
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("\n\nSuggestion from DeepSeek API:")
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(suggestion)
    end
  end)
end

_G.suggest = function()
  local now = vim.loop.hrtime() / 1000000
  if api_call_in_progress or (now - last_api_call_time < user_opts.debounce_time) then
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("API call in progress or too recent, skipping.")
    return
  end

  api_call_in_progress = true
  last_api_call_time = now
  local deepseek_request_body = {
    model = "deepseek-chat",
    echo = false,
    frequency_penalty = 0,
    max_tokens = 4096,
    presence_penalty = 0,
    stop = nil,
    stream = false,
    stream_options = nil,
    temperature = 1,
    top_p = 1,
    messages = rktmb_deepseek_complete.build_messages_table(
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_before_cursor(),
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_after_cursor(),
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_before_cursor_line()
    )
  }

  -- Asynchronously make the POST request
  curl.post('https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions', {
    body = vim.fn.json_encode(deepseek_request_body),
    headers = {
      ["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
      ["Accept"] = "application/json",
      ["Authorization"] = "Bearer " .. user_opts.deepseek_api_key
    },
    callback = function(response)
      api_call_in_progress = false -- Reset the flag after receiving the response
      process_deepseek_response(response)
    end
  })
end

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)
  end
})

-- Key mappings for printable characters
local function is_printable_char(char)
  return char >= 32 and char <= 126  -- ASCII printable characters
end

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertCharPre", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    local char = vim.fn.getchar()
    if is_printable_char(char) then
      -- Clear existing extmarks when typing a printable character
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)
    end
  end
})

-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Space key
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", " ", "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR> ", { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Uncomment these if you want to use them
-- vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_all_keymap,    "<Cmd>lua accept_the_whole_suggestion()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
-- vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_line_keymap,   "<Cmd>lua accept_one_suggestion_line()<CR>",  { noremap = true, silent = true })
-- vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_word_keymap   ,"<Cmd>lua accept_one_suggestion_word()<CR>",  { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Summary of Changes
- The `TextChangedI` autocommand has been replaced with an `InsertCharPre` autocommand that checks for printable characters.
- The suggestion clearing logic is now only triggered when a printable character is typed, allowing the suggestion to remain visible when the user types other non-printable characters (like backspace or arrow keys).

This should fulfill your requirement to keep the suggestions visible while allowing for user input without clearing them unnecessarily.
