# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

When the user types fast, the suggestion may only be triggered if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.
That is the behavior I want.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types `<M-ESC>` key, a suggestion is triggered and the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
If the user continues typing, the suggestion is cleared.
If the types `<M-ESC>` key again, the suggestion is triggered and the new suggestion is displayed when it arrives.
This is repeatable any number of times.

This is the behavior I want.

## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

When a suggestion is displayed, I want the user to be able to accept it word by word with the `<M-Right>` key.
So, as far as there is a suggestion, if the user presses `<M-Right>`, 
the first word of the suggestion is accepted and transformed into text at the same position.

Tell me the modifications I need to make in order to achieve that.

```lua
-- lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
-- ... (Existing code) ...

local function split_into_words(text)
  -- Simple word splitting using whitespace as delimiter.  Consider more robust methods if needed.
  return vim.split(text, "%%%%s+", {plain=true})
end

function M.accept_suggestion_word()
    if _G.current_suggestion then
        local words = split_into_words(_G.current_suggestion)
        if #words > 0 then
            local word = words[1]
            local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
            local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
            local row = position[1] - 1
            local col = position[2]

            -- Insert the accepted word into the buffer
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(current_buf, row, col, row, col, {word})

            -- Remove the accepted word from the suggestion
            _G.current_suggestion = string.sub(_G.current_suggestion, #word + 1)

            -- Update the displayed suggestion (clear and redraw)
            clear_suggestion()
            if _G.current_suggestion and #_G.current_suggestion > 0 then
                M.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
            end

        else
            _G.current_suggestion = nil -- Clear suggestion if no words left
            clear_suggestion()
        end
    end
end

-- ... (Existing code) ...

_G.suggest = function()
    -- ... (Existing code) ...

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-Right>", "<Cmd>lua require('rktmb-deepseek-complete').accept_suggestion_word()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **`lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`:**
    * **`split_into_words(text)`:** This new function splits the suggestion text into a table of words based on whitespace.  You might need to refine this for more complex word separation (e.g., handling punctuation).
    * **`M.accept_suggestion_word()`:** This function handles accepting the next word of the suggestion. It inserts the word into the buffer at the cursor position, removes the accepted word from `_G.current_suggestion`, and then redraws the remaining suggestion using `clear_suggestion()` and `M.set_suggestion_extmark()`.

* **`plugin/init.lua`:**
    * **`<M-Right>` keymapping:** A keymapping is added in insert mode to call the `accept_suggestion_word()` function when `<M-Right>` is pressed.


With these changes, pressing `<M-Right>` in insert mode will insert the next word of the DeepSeek suggestion into your buffer.  The displayed suggestion will update to show the remaining part of the suggestion.  When all words are accepted, the suggestion is cleared.  This provides the word-by-word acceptance behavior you requested.
