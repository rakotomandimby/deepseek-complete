# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

I wrote `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

But when I type `<M-PageDown>`, the error message appears:

```
E5108: Error executing lua [string ":lua"]:1: module 'plugin.init' not found:
        no field package.preload['plugin.init']
cache_loader: module plugin.init not found
cache_loader_lib: module plugin.init not found
        no file './plugin/init.lua'
stack traceback:
        [C]: in function 'require'
        [string ":lua"]:1: in main chunk
```

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to fix the issue.

The error message `module 'plugin.init' not found` indicates that Neovim can't locate your `plugin/init.lua` file.  This is likely a path issue. Neovim searches for Lua modules in specific locations defined by the `runtimepath` option.

Here's how to fix it and improve your code:

```lua
-- plugin/init.lua
-- Require the module.  The issue was here. Use 'rktmb-deepseek-complete' not 'plugin.init'
local deepseek_complete = require('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

local M = {}

-- ... (rest of your code remains the same)

return M
```

**Explanation of the fix:**

You were trying to `require('plugin.init')` inside `plugin/init.lua` itself, creating a circular dependency.  The correct way to require your module which is located at `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` is `require('rktmb-deepseek-complete')`.  Neovim's module loading mechanism will correctly resolve this path based on your file structure.


**Improved `plugin/init.lua` (with best practices):**

```lua
-- plugin/init.lua
local deepseek_complete = require('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

local M = {}

-- Store the namespace once, not every time the suggestion is shown
M.suggestion_ns = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('suggestion_ns')

-- Define the highlight group once
vim.cmd('highlight SuggestionGrey guifg=#808080')


function M.clear_suggestion()
  if M._suggestion then
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(M._suggestion.bufnr, M._suggestion.start_line -1 , M._suggestion.end_line -1, false, {})
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(M._suggestion.bufnr, M.suggestion_ns, M._suggestion.start_line -1, M._suggestion.end_line -1)
    M._suggestion = nil
    -- Use vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_name for better performance
    vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_name('SuggestionAutocmd')
  end
end

function M.show_suggestion()
  M.clear_suggestion()

  local suggestion = deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local cursor = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local line = cursor[1] - 1
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)


  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, line, line, false, lines)


  for i = 1, #lines do
    vim.api.nvim_buf_add_highlight(bufnr, M.suggestion_ns, 'SuggestionGrey', line + i -1, 0, -1)
  end

  vim.api.nvim_create_augroup('SuggestionAutocmd', { clear = true })
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "TextChangedI", "CursorMovedI" }, {
    group = 'SuggestionAutocmd',
    buffer = bufnr,
    callback = function() M.clear_suggestion() end,
  })

  M._suggestion = {
    bufnr = bufnr,
    start_line = line + 1,
    end_line = line + #lines +1,
  }
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {line + #lines, 0})
end


vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<M-PageDown>', '<Cmd>lua require("plugin.init").show_suggestion()<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })

return M
```


Key improvements:

* **Correct `require` path:** Fixes the main issue.
* **Namespace and Highlight Group Management:**  Creating the namespace and highlight group only once improves efficiency.
* **Autocommand Cleanup:** Using `vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_name` is more efficient than `autocmd!`.
* **Simplified Line Insertion:**  No longer need to add 1 to the line number for insertion.
* **Cursor Placement:** Added `vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor` to move the cursor to the end of the suggestion.
* **Zero-based indexing fix:** Corrected the indexing issues related to line numbers.


With these changes, your plugin should work as intended.  Remember to restart Neovim or source the `init.lua` file after making these modifications.
