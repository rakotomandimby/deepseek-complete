# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

With the existing code, after I type `<M-PageDown>`:
- The cursor is placed at the end of the line.
- The letter "a" appended to the end of the line.
- I see "Entered generate_sentence()" in the log file.
- The suggestion doens't appear in the buffer: this is the problem to solve.
- There is no error message.

Analyze the code and tell me how to get the suggestion to appear in the buffer.
If some debug is needed, tell me where to put the log instructions.

To ensure that the inline suggestion appears correctly in the buffer when you trigger the `<M-PageDown>` key sequence, we need to make a few adjustments to the `show_suggestion` function in `plugin/init.lua`. 

### Key Adjustments Needed

1. **Cursor Positioning**: After placing the cursor at the end of the line, we need to ensure that the suggestion is displayed correctly without overlapping the existing text.
2. **Using `virt_text`**: The `virt_text` should be set in a way that it pushes down the lines below it instead of overlapping.
3. **Debugging**: Adding log statements to track the flow of execution and to ensure that the suggestion is being generated and displayed correctly.

### Updated Code

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `plugin/init.lua` file to achieve the desired behavior:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

-- Define the highlight group for the suggestion text
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "InlineSuggestion", { fg = "#808080", bg = "NONE" })

-- Global variables to keep track of extmarks
_G.current_extmarks = nil

-- Function to clear the current suggestion
local function clear_suggestion()
  if _G.current_extmarks then
    for _, extmark in pairs(_G.current_extmarks) do
      vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, extmark.ns, extmark.id)
    end
    _G.current_extmarks = nil
  end
end

local function show_suggestion()
  clear_suggestion()
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  
  -- Move cursor to the end of the line
  vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes("<Esc>A", true, false, true), 'n', false)
  
  local current_cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  
  -- Log the generated suggestion for debugging
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Generated suggestion: " .. suggestion)

  local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')
  _G.current_extmarks = {}
  
  -- Set the extmark *at the current cursor position*
  local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, current_cursor_pos[1] - 1, current_cursor_pos[2], {
    virt_text = { { suggestion, "InlineSuggestion" } },
    virt_text_pos = 'eol',  -- Position the suggestion at the end of the line
    hl_mode = 'combine',     -- Combine highlight with existing text
  })
  
  table.insert(_G.current_extmarks, { ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id })
  
  -- Log the extmark ID for debugging
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Set extmark ID: " .. extmark_id)

  -- Move the cursor back to the end of the line
  vim.api.nvim_feedkeys("a", 'n', false)
end

-- Map <M-PageDown> to show_suggestion in insert mode
vim.keymap.set('i', '<M-PageDown>', show_suggestion, { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when typing
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when leaving insert mode
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})
```

### Key Changes Explained

1. **`virt_text_pos = 'eol'`**: This positions the suggestion at the end of the line, ensuring it does not overlap with existing text.
2. **Logging**: Added log statements to track the generated suggestion and the extmark ID. This will help in debugging if the suggestion does not appear as expected.
3. **Cursor Management**: The cursor is moved back to the end of the line after setting the suggestion.

### Debugging

- Check the log file `/tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log` to see if the generated suggestion and extmark ID are being logged correctly.
- If the suggestion still does not appear, ensure that the highlight group `InlineSuggestion` is defined correctly and that there are no conflicting settings in your Neovim configuration.

With these changes, the inline suggestion should now appear correctly when you trigger it with `<M-PageDown>`.
