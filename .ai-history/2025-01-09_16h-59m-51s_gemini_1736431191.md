## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

Note: I want to implement the same accept word as Gihub Copilot and Supermaven Neovim plugins. 

When a suggestion is displayed as extmark, I want that if I press `<M-Right>` key,
the first word of the suggestion transformes into text at the same position.

The space between the current cusor position and the first word of the suggestion must be preserved, if any.

Givi me the code of the `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function that implements this behavior.

```lua
-- lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
-- ... (rest of the code)

function M.accept_suggestion_word()
  if _G.current_suggestion == nil then
    return
  end

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
  local col = position[2]

  local suggestion = _G.current_suggestion
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)
  local first_line = lines[1]

  -- Extract the first word (or up to the first space)
  local first_word = string.match(first_line, "^([^%%%%s]+)")
  if first_word == nil then  -- No word found, clear suggestion
    M.clear_suggestion()
    _G.current_suggestion = nil
    return
  end

  -- Calculate the number of spaces to preserve
  local spaces = string.match(first_line, "^(%%%%s*)") or ""

  -- Insert the first word and spaces into the buffer
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(current_buf, row, col, row, col, {spaces .. first_word})

  -- Update the cursor position
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {row + 1, col + #spaces + #first_word})

  -- Remove the accepted word from the suggestion
  lines[1] = string.sub(first_line, #spaces + #first_word + 1)
  _G.current_suggestion = table.concat(lines, "\n")

  -- If the suggestion is now empty, clear it
  if _G.current_suggestion == "" or _G.current_suggestion == nil then
    M.clear_suggestion()
    _G.current_suggestion = nil
  else
    -- Redraw the remaining suggestion
    M.clear_suggestion()
    M.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
  end
end

-- ... (rest of the code)
```

Key changes:

* **Handles empty suggestions:** The function now checks if `_G.current_suggestion` is nil or empty and returns early if so.  This prevents errors when trying to accept words when there's no suggestion.
* **Preserves spaces:** The code now correctly extracts and preserves leading spaces before the first word in the suggestion.
* **Updates cursor position:** After inserting the word, the cursor is moved to the end of the inserted text.
* **Clears suggestion when empty:**  After accepting the last word, the suggestion is cleared.
* **Redraws remaining suggestion:** After accepting a word, the remaining part of the suggestion is redrawn as an extmark.  This ensures the user always sees the updated suggestion.


No changes are required in `plugin/init.lua` as the keymapping for `<M-Right>` is already set up to call `M.accept_suggestion_word()`.
