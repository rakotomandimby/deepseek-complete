# Consider error message as a suggestion, if any

In `./plugin/init.lua`, the function   `process_deepseek_response()` is called when the DeepSeek API returns a response.

If the response code is 200, it performes the suggestion insertion in the buffer.
For other response codes, it logs the error messages and does nothing more.

For 200 to 599 response codes, the error message is in `body.choices[1].message.content` , it is the same JSON path when success and failure.

I want that for 400 to 599 response codes also, the error messages are logged and also inserted as suggestions in the buffer.

Tell me the modifications I have to make to get the error messages logged and also inserted as suggestions in the buffer.

Key changes:

1. **Handle 4xx and 5xx status codes:** The `process_deepseek_response` function now checks if `response.status` is between 400 and 599. If so, it logs the error and proceeds to treat the error message as a suggestion.  It also checks for the `body.error.message` field in case the `body.choices` structure is absent in error responses.

2. **Extract error message:**  The code extracts the error message from `body.choices[1].message.content` if available, or from `body.error.message` if it's an error response. This ensures that both success and error messages are handled consistently.

3. **Log and use error message as suggestion:** The extracted `message_content` (which could be an error message) is then used as the `suggestion` and inserted into the buffer using the existing logic.  This makes error messages visible to the user as suggestions.

4. **Early return for other non-200 statuses:**  The code now includes an early `return` statement for non-200 status codes other than 4xx and 5xx to prevent further processing in those cases.

5. **Handle missing error messages:** The code now checks if `message_content` is empty after attempting to extract it. If it is, it logs a message indicating that no error message was found and returns early to prevent errors.


With these changes, the plugin will now display error messages from the DeepSeek API as suggestions in the buffer, allowing users to see and potentially use the information provided in the error message. It also handles cases where the error response doesn't contain a `choices` array or an error message.
