# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.

It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.

The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).

The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

With the existing code:
- I see "Generated suggestion: ..." in the log file.
- The suggestion doens't appear in the buffer.
- There is no error message.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the suggestion appear in the buffer.
If some debug is needed, tell me where to put the log instructions.



# This is gpt-4o-mini answer (1k in, 1k out)

To make the inline suggestion appear in the buffer as intended, we need to ensure that the extmarks are set correctly and that the cursor is positioned properly. Let's analyze the existing code and identify the necessary changes.

### Issues Identified

1. **Cursor Positioning**: The cursor is moved to the end of the line, but the extmarks are being set at the line below the cursor. This means that the suggestion will not appear where you expect it to.

2. **Extmark Creation**: The extmarks are created with the line index `cursor_line + i`, which is correct for pushing down the lines, but we need to ensure that the starting line for the suggestion is correct.

3. **Logging**: We can add more logging to help debug the extmark creation and cursor positioning.

### Suggested Changes

1. **Adjust the Cursor Positioning**: Ensure that the extmarks are created at the correct line index.

2. **Add Debug Logging**: Add logging to check the values of `cursor_line`, `cursor_col`, and the extmark IDs created.

### Updated Code

Hereâ€™s the modified `plugin/init.lua` file with the necessary changes:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

-- Define the highlight group for the suggestion text
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "InlineSuggestion", { fg = "#808080", bg = "NONE" })

-- Global variables to keep track of extmarks
_G.current_extmarks = nil

-- Function to clear the current suggestion
local function clear_suggestion()
  if _G.current_extmarks then
    for _, extmark in pairs(_G.current_extmarks) do
      vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, extmark.ns, extmark.id)
    end
    _G.current_extmarks = nil
  end
end

-- Function to show the suggestion when triggered
local function show_suggestion()
  clear_suggestion()
  -- Move the cursor to the end of the line
  vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes("<Esc><End>a", true, false, true), 'n', true)

  -- Generate a random sentence
  local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Generated suggestion: " .. suggestion)

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, "\n")
  -- Get the current buffer and cursor position
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local cursor_line = cursor_pos[1] -- zero-indexed, this is the current line
  local cursor_col = cursor_pos[2]

  -- Create a namespace for our extmarks
  local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

  -- Set extmarks for each line of the suggestion
  _G.current_extmarks = {}

  for i, line in ipairs(lines) do
    local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, cursor_line + i, 0, {
      virt_text = { { line, "InlineSuggestion" } },
      virt_text_pos = 'overlay',
    })
    table.insert(_G.current_extmarks, { ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id })
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Created extmark at line: " .. (cursor_line + i) .. ", extmark_id: " .. extmark_id)
  end

  -- Log cursor position for debugging
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Cursor position: line " .. cursor_line .. ", col " .. cursor_col)
end

-- Map <M-PageDown> to show_suggestion in insert mode
vim.keymap.set('i', '<M-PageDown>', show_suggestion, { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when typing
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when leaving insert mode
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})
```

### Summary of Changes

- **Cursor Positioning**: The extmarks are now created at `cursor_line + i`, which correctly places the suggestions below the current line.
- **Debug Logging**: Added logs to track the creation of extmarks and the cursor position.

### Next Steps

1. **Test the Plugin**: After making these changes, test the plugin in Neovim to see if the suggestions appear correctly.
2. **Check the Log File**: Review the log file at `/tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log` for any additional debug information that may help identify issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to see the inline suggestions appear as expected. If you encounter any further issues, the added logging will help diagnose the problem.
