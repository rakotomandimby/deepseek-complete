# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

The suggestion is triggered each time the user type the space key.
When the user types fast, the suggestion is triggered only if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types, the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
But as far as the user types, the suggestion must be cleared.

If a new suggestion comes, the old suggestion must be cleared.

IF the user continues typing, the suggestion must be cleared and the new suggestion will be displayed when it arrives.

This behaviour must be repeatable any time the user types.

Tell me the modifications I need to make to the code in order to achieve that.

Your code already implements most of the desired functionality. The primary issue lies in clearing the existing extmark *before* setting a new one.  This, combined with the debouncing logic, should resolve the unwanted flickering and ensure suggestions are displayed correctly.

Here's the modified `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`:

```lua
-- lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
local M = {}

-- ... (Existing code remains unchanged)

function M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
  -- Remove Markdown code block delimiters from the suggestion
  suggestion = M.remove_markdown_delimiters(suggestion)

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
  local col = position[2]

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)


  -- Clear existing extmarks  *** KEY CHANGE ***
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)


  -- Insert empty lines into the buffer if necessary
  if #lines > 1 then
    local num_lines_to_insert = #lines - 1
    -- Insert empty lines after current line
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + 1, row + 1, false, vim.fn['repeat']({' '}, num_lines_to_insert))
  end

  -- ... (Rest of the function remains unchanged)
end

-- ... (Rest of the file remains unchanged)

return M
```

Here's the modified `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
-- plugin/init.lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

-- ... (Existing code)

_G.suggest = function()
    -- Clear existing extmarks before making a new suggestion. *** KEY CHANGE ***
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

    -- ... (Rest of the function remains unchanged)
end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", { -- Triggered on every character typed in insert mode
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    -- Clear existing extmarks when typing.
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)
  end
})

-- ... (Rest of the file remains unchanged)
```

Key Changes and Explanation:

1. **Clearing Extmarks Before Setting New Ones:** The most crucial change is clearing the namespace using `vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace()` *before* setting the new extmark in both the `_G.suggest()` function and the `TextChangedI` autocommand. This prevents the flickering and overlapping suggestions.  The `_G.suggest()` function now clears the previous suggestion before sending a new request to the DeepSeek API.

2. **`TextChangedI` Autocommand:** The `TextChangedI` autocommand ensures the suggestion is cleared whenever the user types a character in insert mode. This provides the desired behavior of clearing the suggestion as the user continues typing.  This is the most reliable way to clear the suggestion on every keypress.



With these modifications, the plugin should behave as expected, providing inline suggestions, clearing them as the user types, and preventing excessive API calls due to the debouncing mechanism.  The suggestions will now appear cleanly without overlapping or flickering.
