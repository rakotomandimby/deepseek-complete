# Accept the first line of the suggestion and triger again

There is a keymap and a function to accept the whole suggestion: `_G.accept_the_whole_suggestion`.

I want to accept the first line of the suggestion with a keymap `<M-Down>`.
I also want that when I accept the first line, the remaining suggestions lines are discarded and another suggestion is triggered based on that accepted line.

Tell me what I need to change in the code to achieve what I want.

```lua
-- plugin/init.lua
-- ... (rest of the code)

_G.accept_one_suggestion_line = function()
  if not _G.current_extmark_id or not _G.current_suggestion then
    -- No active suggestion to accept
    return
  end

  local bufnr = 0
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local current_line = cursor_pos[1]

  -- Get the first line of the suggestion
  local first_suggestion_line = _G.current_suggestion[1]

  -- Insert the first line of the suggestion into the buffer
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, current_line - 1, current_line - 1, false, { first_suggestion_line })

  -- Move the cursor to the next line, after the inserted text
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line, #first_suggestion_line })

  -- Clear existing extmark and suggestion
  vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, _G.current_extmark_id)
  _G.current_extmark_id = nil
  _G.current_suggestion = nil

  -- Trigger a new suggestion
  vim.schedule(suggest) -- Use vim.schedule to avoid "recursive" lua call
end

-- ... (rest of the code)
```

Key changes and explanations:

1. **Cursor Placement:** The cursor is now moved to the *end* of the newly inserted line using `vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line, #first_suggestion_line })`. This allows the next suggestion to build upon the complete accepted line.

2. **Clearing Existing Suggestion:**  Before triggering the new suggestion, the old `extmark` and `_G.current_suggestion` are explicitly cleared. This prevents conflicts and ensures a clean start for the next suggestion.

3. **Triggering New Suggestion:** The `suggest()` function is called using `vim.schedule(suggest)`.  This is crucial. Directly calling `suggest()` within `accept_one_suggestion_line()` would create a recursive Lua call, which can lead to issues. `vim.schedule()` defers the call to `suggest()` until after the current function completes, avoiding recursion.

With these changes, pressing `<M-Down>` will insert the first line of the suggestion, clear the remaining suggestions, and immediately trigger a new suggestion based on the updated buffer content. This creates the desired iterative suggestion behavior.  No changes are needed in `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`.
