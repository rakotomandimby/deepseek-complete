# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.

Problem: 
- The DeepSeek API response is a multiline string 
- The extmark covers the lines below the cursor position

Tell me what modifications I need the multiline suggestion to push down the text below the cursor in order to avoid the overlap.



# This is o1-preview answer (3k in, 2k out)

To solve the problem where the multiline suggestion overlaps with the text below the cursor, we need to adjust how we display the suggestion using Neovim's virtual text features.

Currently, in your `M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)` function, you're using the `virt_text` option with `nvim_buf_set_extmark`, which overlays virtual text on existing buffer lines without modifying the buffer's content. This is why the multiline suggestion overlaps with the text below the cursorâ€”it's being drawn over the existing lines rather than pushing them down.

**Solution: Use `virt_lines` to Display Multiline Suggestions**

To make the suggestion appear as if it's part of the buffer and push down the existing text without actually modifying the buffer, we can use the `virt_lines` option of `nvim_buf_set_extmark`. The `virt_lines` option allows us to display virtual lines below (or above) a given line, which will visually push down the text in the buffer.

Here's how you can modify your `M.set_suggestion_extmark` function to use `virt_lines`:

1. **Modify the Extmark Options**: Instead of using `virt_text`, we'll use `virt_lines` to display the suggestion as virtual lines below the cursor.

2. **Adjust the Extmark Position**: Set the extmark at the cursor's row and column.

3. **Handle Empty Lines**: Ensure that if the suggestion has empty lines, they are displayed correctly.

### Updated `M.set_suggestion_extmark` Function:

```lua
function M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
  -- Remove Markdown code block delimiters from the suggestion
  suggestion = M.remove_markdown_delimiters(suggestion)

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
  local col = position[2]

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)

  -- Clear existing extmarks
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Prepare virt_lines
  local virt_lines = {}
  for _, line in ipairs(lines) do
    table.insert(virt_lines, { { line, "Comment" } })
  end

  -- Set the extmark with virt_lines below the cursor
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(
    current_buf,
    _G.ns_id,
    row,
    col,
    {
      virt_lines = virt_lines,
      virt_lines_above = false, -- Place virt_lines below the current line
      hl_mode = 'combine',
    }
  )
end
```

**Explanation:**

- **`virt_lines`**: This option allows us to display virtual lines that appear between the buffer's actual lines. By setting `virt_lines_above = false`, these lines will appear below the line at which the extmark is placed.
- **Positioning**: We place the extmark at the cursor's current row and column. The `virt_lines` will then appear starting from this position and push down the existing text visually.
- **Highlighting**: The `hl_mode = 'combine'` option ensures that the text uses the specified highlight group (`Comment` in this case).

**Notes:**

- This method requires Neovim 0.9 or later, as `virt_lines` is a relatively recent addition.
- The virtual lines do not modify the buffer; they are purely visual. When the user accepts the suggestion, you can then insert the text into the buffer.

### Accepting the Suggestion

You'll need to implement a function that inserts the suggested text into the buffer when the user accepts it. For example:

```lua
function _G.accept_suggestion()
  if _G.current_suggestion then
    local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
    local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
    local row = position[1] - 1
    local col = position[2]

    -- Split the suggestion into lines
    local lines = vim.split(
      M.remove_markdown_delimiters(_G.current_suggestion),
      '\n',
      true
    )

    -- Insert the suggestion into the buffer
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(
      current_buf,
      row,
      col,
      row,
      col,
      lines
    )

    -- Clear the extmark
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)
    _G.current_suggestion = nil
  end
end

-- Map a key to accept the suggestion
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-CR>", "<Cmd>lua accept_suggestion()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

**Explanation:**

- **`accept_suggestion` Function**: This inserts the suggested text into the buffer at the cursor's position.
- **Updating the Buffer**: `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text` modifies the buffer by replacing the text from the start position to the end position with the provided lines.
- **Clearing the Extmark**: After accepting the suggestion, we clear the extmark to remove the virtual lines.
- **Key Mapping**: Here, `<M-CR>` (Alt+Enter) is mapped to accept the suggestion. You can choose any key combination you prefer.

### Additional Considerations

- **Handle Buffer Changes**: If the buffer content changes after the suggestion is displayed (e.g., the user types more), you may need to update or clear the suggestion. You can set up autocommands to handle events like `TextChangedI`.
  
  ```lua
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)
      _G.current_suggestion = nil
    end
  })
  ```

- **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the functions handle edge cases, such as the cursor being at the end of the buffer or the suggestion having more lines than the remaining buffer lines.

- **User Experience**: Consider providing visual cues (like a different highlight group) to indicate that the text is a suggestion.

### Update `plugin/init.lua` to Reflect Changes

Since we changed how the suggestion is displayed and accepted, make sure your `plugin/init.lua` reflects these changes, particularly the key mappings.

```lua
-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-CR>", "<Cmd>lua accept_suggestion()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Clear suggestion on InsertLeave
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)
    _G.current_suggestion = nil
  end
})
```

**Ensure Compatibility with Neovim Version**

The use of `virt_lines` requires Neovim 0.9 or later. If you need to support earlier versions, you'll have to explore alternative approaches, such as manually adjusting the buffer or using other virtual text strategies.

### Alternative Approach for Older Neovim Versions

If you cannot use `virt_lines`, another approach is to display the suggestion using a floating window positioned at the cursor. However, this is more complex and can be intrusive.

### Final Thoughts

By using `virt_lines`, you can display multiline suggestions that push down the existing text without modifying the buffer. This should resolve the overlap issue you're experiencing.
