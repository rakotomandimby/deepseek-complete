## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

When a suggestion is displayed, I want the user to be able to accept one word with the `<M-Right>` key.

As far as there is a suggestion, if the user presses `<M-Right>`, 
the first word of the suggestion is accepted and transformed into text at the same position.

Note: Gihub Copilot and Supermaven Neovim plugins do that.

The suggestion might be on the same line as the cursor or on a different line: we have to handle that case.

With the current implementation, if the suggestion is on the same line as the cursor, he get the following error:

```
E5108: Error executing lua ...m/lazy/deepseek-complete/lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua:92: attempt to get length of local 'leading_newlines' (a nil value)
```

This is because `M.accept_suggestion_word()` looks for a leading newline character in the suggestion but there is none because the suggestion is on the same line as the cursor.

Tell me the changes I need to make in order to achieve accepting one word of a suggestion when issuing the `<M-Right>` key until the end of the line. Then continue to the next line, and so on.

To achieve accepting one word of the suggestion when the user presses `<M-Right>`, including when the suggestion is on the same line as the cursor, you'll need to modify the `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function in your `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` file.

The error you're encountering:

```
E5108: Error executing lua ...m/lazy/deepseek-complete/lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua:92: attempt to get length of local 'leading_newlines' (a nil value)
```

occurs because `leading_newlines` is `nil` when there are no leading newline characters in the suggestion. Attempting to get the length of `nil` causes an error.

Here's how you can fix the issue and implement the desired functionality:

### **1. Modify `M.accept_suggestion_word()` Function**

Update the `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function to properly handle cases where there are no leading newlines and to accept one word at a time from the suggestion.

**Replace the existing `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function with the following code:**

```lua
function M.accept_suggestion_word()
    if _G.current_suggestion then
        -- Find the position of the next space or newline
        local next_space = _G.current_suggestion:find("%%s")
        local split_pos = next_space

        local word = ""
        if split_pos then
            word = _G.current_suggestion:sub(1, split_pos - 1)
        else
            word = _G.current_suggestion
        end

        -- Handle the case where there are leading newline characters
        local leading_newlines = _G.current_suggestion:match("^\n*")
        local num_newlines = leading_newlines and #leading_newlines or 0

        -- Move cursor down if there are leading newlines
        local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
        local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
        local row = position[1] - 1
        local col = position[2]

        if num_newlines > 0 then
            row = row + num_newlines
            col = 0
            vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + 1, col })
        end

        -- Insert the accepted word into the buffer
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(current_buf, row, col, row, col, { word })

        -- Update cursor position after insertion
        col = col + #word
        vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + 1, col })

        -- Remove the accepted word and any leading whitespace/newlines from the suggestion
        local remaining_suggestion = _G.current_suggestion:sub(#leading_newlines + #word + 1)
        remaining_suggestion = remaining_suggestion:gsub("^%%s*", "")  -- Remove any leading whitespace

        _G.current_suggestion = remaining_suggestion

        -- Update the displayed suggestion (clear and redraw)
        M.clear_suggestion()
        if _G.current_suggestion and #_G.current_suggestion > 0 then
            M.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
        else
            _G.current_suggestion = nil -- Clear suggestion if no text left
        end
    end
end
```

### **2. Explanation of the Changes**

#### **Handling `leading_newlines` When It's `nil`**

- **Original Code:**
  ```lua
  local leading_newlines = _G.current_suggestion:match("^\n+")
  ```
  When there are no leading newlines, `leading_newlines` becomes `nil`.

- **Updated Code:**
  ```lua
  local leading_newlines = _G.current_suggestion:match("^\n*")
  ```
  The `*` quantifier matches zero or more occurrences, so `leading_newlines` will be an empty string (`""`) when there are no leading newlines. This prevents `leading_newlines` from being `nil`.

#### **Calculating `num_newlines`**

- **Updated Code:**
  ```lua
  local num_newlines = leading_newlines and #leading_newlines or 0
  ```
  This ensures that `num_newlines` is `0` when there are no leading newlines.

#### **Adjusting Cursor Position**

- If there are leading newlines, the cursor moves down `num_newlines` rows, and the column is reset to `0`.

- If there are no leading newlines, the cursor stays on the same line and column.

#### **Extracting the Next Word**

- **Updated Code:**
  ```lua
  local next_space = _G.current_suggestion:find("%%s")
  local split_pos = next_space

  if split_pos then
      word = _G.current_suggestion:sub(1, split_pos - 1)
  else
      word = _G.current_suggestion
  end
  ```
  This code finds the position of the next whitespace character (space, tab, or newline) and extracts the word before it.

#### **Removing Accepted Word from the Suggestion**

- **Updated Code:**
  ```lua
  local remaining_suggestion = _G.current_suggestion:sub(#leading_newlines + #word + 1)
  remaining_suggestion = remaining_suggestion:gsub("^%%s*", "")  -- Remove any leading whitespace

  _G.current_suggestion = remaining_suggestion
  ```
  This updates `_G.current_suggestion` by removing the accepted word and any leading whitespace characters, preparing it for the next acceptance.

#### **Updating Suggestion Display**

- After accepting a word, the suggestion display is cleared and updated if there's remaining suggestion text.

### **3. Testing the Changes**

#### **Case 1: Suggestion on the Same Line**

- **Before Fix:**
  - Error occurs due to `leading_newlines` being `nil`.
  - Accepting a word doesn't work.

- **After Fix:**
  - No error.
  - Pressing `<M-Right>` accepts the next word from the suggestion and inserts it at the cursor position.
  - Cursor moves forward by the length of the accepted word.
  - Suggestion display updates to reflect the remaining suggestion.

#### **Case 2: Suggestion Spanning Multiple Lines**

- Leading newlines are correctly counted, and the cursor moves down accordingly.
- Words are accepted one at a time, respecting newlines in the suggestion.

#### **Continuing to Accept Words**

- You can press `<M-Right>` repeatedly to accept subsequent words from the suggestion.
- Once all words are accepted, the suggestion is cleared.

### **4. Reloading the Plugin**

After making the changes, you'll need to reload the plugin or restart Neovim to apply the updates.

**Optionally**, you can reload the Lua module without restarting Neovim:

```vim
:lua package.loaded["rktmb-deepseek-complete"] = nil
:lua require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
```

### **5. Summary**

By updating the `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function as shown, you:

- Fix the `nil` error when there are no leading newlines in the suggestion.
- Enable word-by-word acceptance of suggestions with the `<M-Right>` key.
- Handle suggestions on the same line as well as those spanning multiple lines.
- Mimic the behavior of GitHub Copilot and Superhuman Neovim plugins.

### **6. Additional Notes**

- Ensure that the key mapping for accepting a word is correctly set. In your `plugin/init.lua`, you have:

  ```lua
  vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_word_keymap, "<Cmd>lua require('rktmb-deepseek-complete').accept_suggestion_word()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
  ```

  Make sure this mapping corresponds to your `<M-Right>` key.

- Consider adding similar error handling and edge case checks in other functions for robustness.

---

By implementing the above changes, you'll achieve the desired functionality of accepting one word from the suggestion at a time, regardless of whether the suggestion is on the same line or multiple lines.
