# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

The suggestion is triggered each time the user type the space key.
When the user types fast, the suggestion is triggered only if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types, the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
But as far as the user types, the suggestion must be cleared.
If a new suggestion comes, the old suggestion must be cleared.
If the user continues typing, the suggestion must be cleared and the new suggestion will be displayed when it arrives.
This behaviour must be repeatable any time the user types.

The current code implements those behaviors, but it has one problem:
- Changing the text in the buffer will cause the suggestion to be cleared.
- When the suggestion pushes down the existing text, it performs a text change.
- When making the place for himself, the suggestion is cleared.

To avoid that, I want to configure the suggestion clearing not when the text is changed but when the user types a printable character.

Tell me the modifications I need to make the suggestion clearing to happen only when the user types a printable character.

The issue you're encountering is due to the `TextChangedI` autocommand firing when the plugin itself modifies the buffer to insert the suggestion.  This is because setting `virt_text` for an extmark also triggers the TextChanged event. You want to differentiate between user-initiated text changes and plugin-initiated changes.

Here's the modified `plugin/init.lua` leveraging the `TextChangedP` event and a guard variable:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

local api_call_in_progress = false
local last_api_call_time = 0
local ignore_text_changed = false -- Guard variable

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

-- ... (rest of your config and functions remain the same)

local function process_deepseek_response(response)
  vim.schedule(function()
    -- ... (your existing response processing code)
    ignore_text_changed = true -- Set the guard before setting extmarks
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
    ignore_text_changed = false -- Unset the guard after setting extmarks
    _G.current_suggestion = suggestion
    -- ... (rest of your logging)
  end)
end


-- ... (rest of your code)

-- Use TextChangedP instead of TextChangedI
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedP", { -- Triggered *after* a printable character is typed
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    if not ignore_text_changed then -- Only clear if not a plugin-initiated change
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)
    end
  end
})

-- Key mappings ... (rest of your keymappings)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **`ignore_text_changed` Guard:** A global variable `ignore_text_changed` is introduced.  It acts as a guard to prevent the clearing of extmarks when the plugin itself is modifying the buffer.

2. **Setting the Guard:** Inside `process_deepseek_response`,  `ignore_text_changed` is set to `true` *before* calling `set_suggestion_extmark` and set back to `false` *afterwards*. This creates a window where the `TextChangedP` autocommand will be ignored.

3. **`TextChangedP` Autocommand:** The autocommand is changed to `TextChangedP`. This event is triggered *after* a printable character is typed or pasted by the user.  It's *not* triggered by programmatic buffer changes like setting `virt_text`.

4. **Conditional Clearing:** Inside the `TextChangedP` callback, the `if not ignore_text_changed then` condition ensures that the extmarks are cleared *only* if the text change was not initiated by the plugin itself.


With these changes, the suggestions will be cleared only when the user types or pastes printable characters, providing the desired behavior.  The plugin's own modifications to the buffer for displaying the suggestion will no longer trigger the clearing action.  The `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` file remains unchanged.
