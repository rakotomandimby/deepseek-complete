## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types `<M-ESC>` key, a suggestion is triggered and the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
But if the user continues typing, the suggestion must be cleared.
If the types `<M-ESC>` key again, the suggestion must be triggered and the new suggestion will be displayed when it arrives.
This must be repeatable any number of times.

Note that inserting suggestions is a text modification, so be careful to not delete the suggestion when inserting it.

With the current code, after the suggestion is displayed and I type something, I get the following error:

```
Error detected while processing InsertCharPre Autocommands for "*":
Error executing lua callback: ....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:29: E565: Not allowed to change text or change window
```

Tell me the modifications I need to make the suggestion clearing .




# This is o1-preview answer (3k in, 3k out)

Certainly! The error you're encountering is due to attempting to modify the buffer during an event (`InsertCharPre`) where text modifications are not allowed in Neovim. Specifically, Neovim restricts certain operations during some events to prevent unstable behavior. The error message:

```
Error detected while processing InsertCharPre Autocommands for "*":
Error executing lua callback: ....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:29: E565: Not allowed to change text or change window
```

indicates that you're trying to change the text or window during the `InsertCharPre` event, which is not permitted.

### **Solution**

To resolve this issue and ensure that the suggestion is cleared when the user types, you need to modify your autocommand to defer the buffer modification until after the event finishes processing. This can be achieved by:

1. **Using `vim.schedule()` to defer the execution of `clear_suggestion`** in the `InsertCharPre` autocommand.
2. **Alternatively, using the `InsertCharPost` event**, which allows buffer modifications during its callback.

I'll provide both solutions so you can choose the one that best fits your needs.

---

### **Option 1: Use `vim.schedule()` in `InsertCharPre`**

Modify your `InsertCharPre` autocommand in the `plugin/init.lua` file to wrap the `clear_suggestion` function call inside `vim.schedule()`. This schedules the function to run after Neovim has finished processing the current event, avoiding the restriction.

#### **Modified Code**

```lua
-- In plugin/init.lua

-- Existing code...

-- Modify the InsertCharPre autocommand
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertCharPre", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.schedule(function()
      clear_suggestion()
    end)
  end
})
```

#### **Explanation**

- **`vim.schedule()`**: This function schedules its callback to be executed in the main event loop after the current event finishes. By wrapping `clear_suggestion()` inside `vim.schedule()`, you're deferring the buffer modification to a safe time.
- This approach keeps your existing logic intact while resolving the error caused by modifying the buffer during `InsertCharPre`.

---

### **Option 2: Use `InsertCharPost` Event**

Alternatively, you can change the autocommand to use the `InsertCharPost` event instead of `InsertCharPre`. The `InsertCharPost` event occurs after the character has been inserted and allows buffer modifications.

#### **Modified Code**

```lua
-- In plugin/init.lua

-- Existing code...

-- Replace the InsertCharPre autocommand with InsertCharPost
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertCharPost", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end
})
```

#### **Explanation**

- **`InsertCharPost`**: This event is triggered after a character has been inserted in Insert mode. Unlike `InsertCharPre`, buffer modifications are allowed during this event's callback.
- By switching to `InsertCharPost`, you eliminate the need to defer execution with `vim.schedule()`.

---

### **Handling Suggestion Insertion**

Since inserting the suggestion is a text modification, you need to ensure that clearing the suggestion does not interfere with inserting it. If you plan to implement functions that accept the suggestion (e.g., `accept_the_whole_suggestion`), you should manage a flag to indicate when a suggestion is being inserted.

#### **Implementing a Flag**

1. **Define a Global Flag**

   ```lua
   -- In plugin/init.lua
   
   _G.suggestion_inserting = false
   ```

2. **Set the Flag When Inserting a Suggestion**

   ```lua
   local function accept_the_whole_suggestion()
     _G.suggestion_inserting = true
     -- Code to accept the suggestion
     -- For example, insert the suggestion into the buffer
     -- ...
     _G.suggestion_inserting = false
   end
   ```

3. **Modify the Autocommand to Check the Flag**

   ```lua
   vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertCharPost", {
     pattern = "*",
     callback = function()
       if not _G.suggestion_inserting then
         clear_suggestion()
       end
     end
   })
   ```

#### **Explanation**

- **Global Flag `_G.suggestion_inserting`**: This flag indicates whether a suggestion is currently being inserted. When set to `true`, the autocommand will skip clearing the suggestion.
- **Checking the Flag**: In the autocommand callback, we check if the flag is `false` before clearing the suggestion. This prevents the suggestion from being cleared while it's being accepted by the user.
- **Resetting the Flag**: After the suggestion has been inserted, make sure to reset the flag to `false`.

---

### **Summary of Changes**

- **Modify the `InsertCharPre` Autocommand**:
  - **Option 1**: Wrap `clear_suggestion()` inside `vim.schedule()` to defer execution.
  - **Option 2**: Use `InsertCharPost` event instead, which allows buffer modifications.
- **Manage Suggestion Insertion**:
  - Define a global flag to indicate when a suggestion is being inserted.
  - Check this flag in your autocommand callback to prevent interference.

---

### **Updated `plugin/init.lua` with Option 2**

Here's how your `plugin/init.lua` might look with the `InsertCharPost` event and the global flag:

```lua
-- In plugin/init.lua

local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

local api_call_in_progress = false
local last_api_call_time = 0

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil
_G.suggestion_inserting = false  -- Global flag

-- Default keymappings
local default_opts = {
  deepseek_api_key = os.getenv("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"),
  suggest_lines_keymap = "<M-ESC>",
  accept_all_keymap = "<M-PageDown>",
  accept_line_keymap = "<M-Down>",
  debounce_time = 1000,
}

local function clear_suggestion()
  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Remove the inserted lines if any
  if _G.num_lines_inserted and _G.num_lines_inserted > 0 then
    local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
    local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + 1, row + 1 + _G.num_lines_inserted, false, {}) -- remove the inserted lines
    _G.num_lines_inserted = 0 -- Reset after removing lines
  end
end

-- Rest of your existing code...

-- Replace the InsertCharPre autocommand with InsertCharPost
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertCharPost", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    if not _G.suggestion_inserting then
      clear_suggestion()
    end
  end
})

-- Update your accept suggestion functions if you have any
-- Example:
-- local function accept_the_whole_suggestion()
--   _G.suggestion_inserting = true
--   -- Insert the suggestion into the buffer
--   -- ...
--   _G.suggestion_inserting = false
-- end

-- Rest of your existing code...

```

---

### **Testing the Changes**

1. **Trigger a Suggestion**: Press `<M-ESC>` to request a suggestion. The suggestion should appear as an extmark.
2. **Type Normally**: Begin typing; the suggestion should clear without errors.
3. **Retrigger Suggestion**: Press `<M-ESC>` again to request a new suggestion. This process should be repeatable any number of times.
4. **Accepting Suggestions**: If you have implemented suggestion acceptance functions (e.g., accepting the whole suggestion), ensure that inserting the suggestion does not clear it prematurely.

---

### **Additional Notes**

- **Avoid Modifying Text During Restricted Events**: Neovim restricts buffer modifications during certain events to maintain stability. Always ensure that any buffer changes are allowed in the context of the event or are deferred using `vim.schedule()`.
- **Extmarks and Buffer Changes**: Be mindful that operations on extmarks and buffer lines can interact in complex ways. Testing your plugin thoroughly will help identify any edge cases.
- **Debounce Mechanism**: Since you have a debounce mechanism for the API calls, ensure that rapid typing still results in the expected behavior without unnecessary API requests.

---

By making these modifications, your plugin should now clear suggestions appropriately when the user types, without encountering the error related to disallowed text changes during events.
