# Error executing vim.schedule lua callback : rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua:46: Invalid `col` : out of range

When `M.set_suggestion_extmark()` is called with the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API, I get the following error:

```
Error executing vim.schedule lua callback : rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua:46: Invalid `col` : out of range
```

This was the response from the DeepSeek API:

```json
{"role":"assistant","content":"```\nvim.opt.cursorline = true\nvim.opt.cursorcolumn = true\n```"}
```

Analyze the code and tell me what actions should be made.

The error `rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua:46: Invalid 'col' : out of range` arises because you're trying to set an `extmark` at a column position (`col`) that's beyond the end of the line.  This happens when the suggestion from DeepSeek inserts newlines, causing subsequent lines of the suggestion to be placed at the original cursor column, which might be past the end of the new lines.

Here's the breakdown of the problem and the solution:

1. **Initial Cursor Position:** The `col` value is captured *before* the suggestion is inserted.

2. **Multi-line Suggestion:** The DeepSeek suggestion contains newline characters (`\n`), creating multiple lines of virtual text.

3. **`col` Out of Range:**  The code attempts to place the virtual text for subsequent lines at the original `col`, which is now beyond the end of those shorter lines.

Here's the corrected `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` file:

```lua
-- Initialize a module
local M = {}

-- ... (Existing logging and markdown removal functions)

function M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
  local initial_col = position[2]  -- Store the initial column

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)

  -- Create virtual text segments for each line
  for i, line in ipairs(lines) do
    local col = initial_col
    if i > 1 then  -- Adjust col for subsequent lines
      col = 0 -- or another suitable value like #line + 1 to append after the line
    end

    if _G.current_extmark_id then
      -- Update existing extmark (This part is unlikely to be reached with multi-line suggestions)
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(current_buf, _G.ns_id, row + i - 1, col, {virt_text = {{line, "Comment"}}})
    else
      -- Create new extmark
      _G.current_extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(current_buf, _G.ns_id, row + i - 1, col, {virt_text = {{line, "Comment"}}})
    end
  end
end

-- ... (Rest of the file remains unchanged)
```

**Key Changes and Explanation:**

* **`initial_col`:** Stores the original column position.
* **`col` Adjustment:** Inside the loop, `col` is reset to `0` (or potentially some other calculated value based on the line length if you want a different placement) for lines *after* the first one. This ensures the `extmark` is placed at a valid column.



No changes are needed in `plugin/init.lua`.  This fix in `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` addresses the root cause of the `col` out of range error.  By resetting `col` for subsequent lines, you prevent the attempt to place virtual text beyond the end of the line. This revised code should correctly display multi-line suggestions from DeepSeek.
