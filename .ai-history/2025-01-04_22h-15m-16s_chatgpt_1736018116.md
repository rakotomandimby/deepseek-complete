# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.

It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.

The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).

The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

With the existing code:
- I see "Generated suggestion: ..." in the log file.
- The suggestion doens't appear in the buffer.
- There is no error message.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the suggestion appear in the buffer.
If some debug is needed, tell me where to put the log instructions.

To make the inline suggestion appear in the buffer as intended, we need to ensure that the extmarks are being set correctly and that the cursor position is managed properly. Let's analyze the existing code and identify the necessary changes.

### Issues Identified

1. **Cursor Positioning**: The cursor is moved to the end of the line, but the extmarks are being set based on the cursor position after moving. This could lead to incorrect placement of the suggestion.

2. **Extmark Creation**: The extmarks are created with the `cursor_line + i - 1`, which may not be correct if the cursor is at the end of the line. We need to ensure that the extmarks are placed correctly below the current line.

3. **Clearing Suggestions**: The suggestion should disappear when typing, which is already handled by the `TextChangedI` and `InsertLeave` autocommands.

### Suggested Changes

1. **Adjust the Extmark Creation Logic**: Ensure that the extmarks are created starting from the line after the current line.

2. **Add Debug Logging**: Add logging to check the values of `cursor_line`, `cursor_col`, and the extmark IDs created.

### Updated Code

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `show_suggestion` function in `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local function show_suggestion()
  clear_suggestion()

  -- Get the current buffer and cursor position *BEFORE* moving the cursor
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local initial_cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the line
  vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes("<Esc><End>a", true, false, true), 'n', true)

  -- Generate a random sentence
  local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Generated suggestion: " .. suggestion)

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, "\n")

  -- Get the cursor position *AFTER* moving to the end of the line. Crucially, use initial_cursor_pos[1] for the line!
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local cursor_line = initial_cursor_pos[1] -- Use the original line number
  local cursor_col = cursor_pos[2]

  -- Log cursor positions for debugging
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Cursor Line: " .. cursor_line .. ", Cursor Column: " .. cursor_col)

  -- Create a namespace for our extmarks
  local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

  -- Set extmarks for each line of the suggestion
  _G.current_extmarks = {}

  for i, line in ipairs(lines) do
    local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, cursor_line + i, cursor_col, {  -- cursor_line + i to push down
      virt_text = { { line, "InlineSuggestion" } },
      virt_text_pos = 'overlay',
    })
    table.insert(_G.current_extmarks, { ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id })
    -- Log extmark ID for debugging
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Created extmark ID: " .. extmark_id .. " at line: " .. (cursor_line + i))
  end
end
```

### Debugging Steps

1. **Log Cursor Positions**: The added log statements will help you verify the cursor's position before and after moving it, as well as the extmark IDs created.

2. **Check the Log File**: After making these changes, check the `/tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log` file to see the logged messages. This will help you understand if the extmarks are being created correctly.

3. **Test the Plugin**: After implementing the changes, test the plugin by triggering the suggestion and typing to see if the suggestions appear and disappear as expected.

By following these steps and making the suggested changes, you should be able to see the inline suggestions appear in the buffer correctly.
