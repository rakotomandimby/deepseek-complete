# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement everything in one step, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).
- Get the content of the current buffer know how to split it into 2 parts: the first part is the text before the cursor, and the second part is the text after the cursor (log the 2 parts into the logs)
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.
If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion disappears.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears, again and again.

That is the desired behavior.

## Step 3: Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).

Now the current code allows to transform the inline suggestion into regular text with the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence.

## Step 4: Get the text before and after the cursor then log it into the logs

Logging is achieved with the following code:

```
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb-deepseek-complete.log("The text to log")
```

When in INSERT mode and issue the `<M-PageDown>` key sequence, I want to add the feature to:
- get the text before the cursor and store it in a variable
- get the text after the cursor and store it in a variable
- log the 2 variables into the logs

The features that already work must continue to work.

Tell me the modifications I need to make to the code in order to achieve what I want.

```lua
-- plugin/init.lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  local current_row, current_col = unpack(vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0))

  -- Get text before and after cursor
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  local text_before_cursor = string.sub(current_line, 1, current_col -1)
  local text_after_cursor = string.sub(current_line, current_col)


  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Text before cursor: " .. text_before_cursor)
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Text after cursor: " .. text_after_cursor)

  -- Ensure the cursor is at the end of the current line  (Needed for proper virtual text placement)
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {current_row, #current_line})


  local sentence = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local lines = vim.split(sentence, "\n", true)

  _G.current_suggestion = lines

  local virt_lines = {}
  for _, line in ipairs(lines) do
    table.insert(virt_lines, { { line, "Comment" } })
  end

  local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_row - 1, 0, {
    virt_lines = virt_lines,
    virt_lines_above = false,
    hl_mode = 'combine'
  })

  _G.current_extmark_id = extmark_id

  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", { clear = true })
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "TextChangedI", "InsertLeave" }, {
    group = augroup_id,
    buffer = 0,
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, ns_id, extmark_id)
      _G.current_extmark_id = nil
      _G.current_suggestion = nil
      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id)
    end
  })
end

_G.accept_suggestion = function()
  -- ... (unchanged)
end

-- ... (rest of the code unchanged)
```

Key changes:

- **Getting cursor position and text before/after:** Inside `suggest_random_sentence()`,  `vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)` now unpacks into `current_row` and `current_col`.  `string.sub` is used to extract the text parts.
- **Logging:** The `rktmb_deepseek_complete.log()` function is used to log the text before and after the cursor.
- **Cursor Placement:** The cursor is still moved to the end of the line *after* getting the text before/after the cursor. This ensures the virtual text is placed correctly, and doesn't interfere with the logic for capturing the text parts.



This revised code fulfills step 4 while maintaining the existing functionality from steps 1-3.  Test it out and let me know if you have any further questions!
