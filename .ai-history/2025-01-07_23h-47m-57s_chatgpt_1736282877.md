# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

The suggestion is triggered each time the user type the space key.

When the user types fast, the suggestion is triggered multiple times in parallell (because it is asynchronous)
and the response from the DeepSeek API is not even received when the user requests a new suggestion.

I want to silently abort HTTP call to the API
- If the plugin is still waiting for a response from the API.
- If API response has been received within the last 500 milliseconds.

Propose me the changes I need to make to the code in order to achieve that.

To implement the desired functionality for your Neovim plugin using the DeepSeek API, we need to make several modifications to the existing code. Below are the changes you need to make to achieve the outlined steps.

### Step 1: Modify `suggest()` to Handle API Call Throttling

We will introduce a mechanism to track the time of the last API call and prevent multiple calls within a short time frame. We will also add a flag to indicate whether a request is currently in progress.

#### Update `plugin/init.lua`

Replace the existing `suggest()` function with the following code:

```lua
local last_request_time = 0
local request_in_progress = false

_G.suggest = function()
  local current_time = vim.loop.now()  -- Get the current time in milliseconds
  if request_in_progress or (current_time - last_request_time < 500) then
    return  -- Abort if a request is in progress or if the last request was within 500ms
  end

  last_request_time = current_time
  request_in_progress = true  -- Set the flag to indicate a request is in progress

  local deepseek_request_body = {
    model = "deepseek-chat",
    echo = false,
    frequency_penalty = 0,
    max_tokens = 4096,
    presence_penalty = 0,
    stop = nil,
    stream = false,
    stream_options = nil,
    temperature = 1,
    top_p = 1,
    messages = rktmb_deepseek_complete.build_messages_table(
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_before_cursor(),
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_after_cursor(),
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_before_cursor_line()
    )
  }

  -- Asynchronously make the POST request
  curl.post('https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions', {
    body = vim.fn.json_encode(deepseek_request_body),
    headers = {
      ["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
      ["Accept"] = "application/json",
      ["Authorization"] = "Bearer " .. user_opts.deepseek_api_key
    },
    callback = function(response)
      request_in_progress = false  -- Reset the flag when the response is received
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Response from DeepSeek API:")
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(response.body)
      process_deepseek_response(response)
    end
  })
end
```

### Step 2: Ensure Extmark Insertion Works as Expected

The existing `set_suggestion_extmark()` function already handles the insertion of the suggestion as an extmark. Ensure that it is correctly called in the `process_deepseek_response()` function.

#### Update `process_deepseek_response()`

Make sure the `process_deepseek_response()` function in `plugin/init.lua` looks like this:

```lua
local function process_deepseek_response(response)
  vim.schedule(function()  -- Use vim.schedule to run this in the main thread
    local response_body = vim.fn.json_decode(response.body)
    if response_body.choices and #response_body.choices > 0 then
      local choice = response_body.choices[1]
      local suggestion = choice.message.content
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("\n\nSuggestion from DeepSeek API:")
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(suggestion)
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
      _G.current_suggestion = suggestion -- Store the current suggestion
    end
  end)
end
```

### Step 3: Key Mappings

Ensure that the key mappings for `<M-ESC>` and space are set correctly in `plugin/init.lua`. The existing mappings should already be sufficient:

```lua
-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", " ", "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR> ", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Final Code Overview

After making these changes, your `plugin/init.lua` should look like this:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

-- Default keymappings
local default_opts = {
  deepseek_api_key = os.getenv("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"),
  suggest_lines_keymap = "<M-ESC>",
  accept_all_keymap = "<M-PageDown>",
  accept_line_keymap = "<M-Down>",
}

-- Read user configuration
local user_opts = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", default_opts, vim.g.rktmb_deepseek_complete_opts or {})

local last_request_time = 0
local request_in_progress = false

_G.suggest = function()
  local current_time = vim.loop.now()  -- Get the current time in milliseconds
  if request_in_progress or (current_time - last_request_time < 500) then
    return  -- Abort if a request is in progress or if the last request was within 500ms
  end

  last_request_time = current_time
  request_in_progress = true  -- Set the flag to indicate a request is in progress

  local deepseek_request_body = {
    model = "deepseek-chat",
    echo = false,
    frequency_penalty = 0,
    max_tokens = 4096,
    presence_penalty = 0,
    stop = nil,
    stream = false,
    stream_options = nil,
    temperature = 1,
    top_p = 1,
    messages = rktmb_deepseek_complete.build_messages_table(
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_before_cursor(),
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_after_cursor(),
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_before_cursor_line()
    )
  }

  -- Asynchronously make the POST request
  curl.post('https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions', {
    body = vim.fn.json_encode(deepseek_request_body),
    headers = {
      ["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
      ["Accept"] = "application/json",
      ["Authorization"] = "Bearer " .. user_opts.deepseek_api_key
    },
    callback = function(response)
      request_in_progress = false  -- Reset the flag when the response is received
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Response from DeepSeek API:")
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(response.body)
      process_deepseek_response(response)
    end
  })
end

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
  end
})

-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", " ", "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR> ", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Conclusion

With these changes, your Neovim plugin should now effectively query the DeepSeek API for inline suggestions while managing the request frequency to avoid overwhelming the API with rapid calls. The suggestions will be displayed as extmarks, enhancing the user experience.
