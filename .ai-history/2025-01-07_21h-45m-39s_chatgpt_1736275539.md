# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now I want to insert the returned by the DeepSeek API as an extmark.
The extmark will be placed after the cursor position.
We will use the `nvim_buf_set_extmark()` function to do that.
The DeepSeek API response is a multiline string, so there might be a processing step to split it into lines.

Tell me what modifications I need to make to the code in order to achieve that.

To achieve the desired functionality of inserting suggestions from the DeepSeek API as extmarks in Neovim, you will need to make several modifications to your existing code. Below are the steps and the corresponding code changes you need to implement.

### Step 1: Modify the `process_deepseek_response` function

You need to update the `process_deepseek_response` function to insert the suggestion as an extmark after the cursor position. Here’s how you can do that:

```lua
local function process_deepseek_response(response)
  vim.schedule(function()  -- Use vim.schedule to run this in the main thread
    local response_body = vim.fn.json_decode(response.body)
    if response_body.choices and #response_body.choices > 0 then
      local choice = response_body.choices[1]
      local suggestion = choice.message.content
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("\n\nSuggestion from DeepSeek API:")
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(suggestion)

      -- Insert the suggestion as an extmark
      local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)  -- Get current cursor position
      local current_line = position[1] - 1  -- Convert to zero-based index
      local current_col = position[2]  -- Column is already zero-based

      -- Split the suggestion into lines
      local suggestion_lines = vim.split(suggestion, "\n")

      -- Insert each line as an extmark
      for i, line in ipairs(suggestion_lines) do
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_line + i, current_col, {
          virt_text = {{line, "Normal"}},
          virt_text_pos = "eol",  -- Position the virtual text at the end of the line
          hl_mode = "combine",  -- Combine highlights
        })
      end
    end
  end)
end
```

### Step 2: Ensure Key Mappings Call `suggest()`

You already have the key mappings set up to call `suggest()` when `<M-ESC>` or the space key is pressed. Ensure that these mappings are correctly defined in your `plugin/init.lua` file:

```lua
-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", " ", "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR> ", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Step 3: Test the Plugin

After making these changes, you should test the plugin to ensure that:

1. When you press `<M-ESC>` or the space key in INSERT mode, the `suggest()` function is called.
2. The suggestion from the DeepSeek API is correctly inserted as extmarks after the cursor position.

### Final Code Overview

Here’s a summary of the modified parts of your code:

#### `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`

```lua
-- Add this function to process the DeepSeek API response
local function process_deepseek_response(response)
  vim.schedule(function()  -- Use vim.schedule to run this in the main thread
    local response_body = vim.fn.json_decode(response.body)
    if response_body.choices and #response_body.choices > 0 then
      local choice = response_body.choices[1]
      local suggestion = choice.message.content
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("\n\nSuggestion from DeepSeek API:")
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(suggestion)

      -- Insert the suggestion as an extmark
      local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)  -- Get current cursor position
      local current_line = position[1] - 1  -- Convert to zero-based index
      local current_col = position[2]  -- Column is already zero-based

      -- Split the suggestion into lines
      local suggestion_lines = vim.split(suggestion, "\n")

      -- Insert each line as an extmark
      for i, line in ipairs(suggestion_lines) do
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_line + i, current_col, {
          virt_text = {{line, "Normal"}},
          virt_text_pos = "eol",  -- Position the virtual text at the end of the line
          hl_mode = "combine",  -- Combine highlights
        })
      end
    end
  end)
end
```

### Conclusion

With these modifications, your Neovim plugin should now be able to provide inline suggestions from the DeepSeek API and insert them as extmarks in the buffer. Make sure to test thoroughly to ensure everything works as expected!
