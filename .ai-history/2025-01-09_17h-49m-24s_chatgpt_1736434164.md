## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

Note: I want to implement the same accept word as Gihub Copilot and Supermaven Neovim plugins. 

When a suggestion is displayed as extmark, when the user issues the `<M-Right>` key,
the first word of the extmark is turned into text at the same position and the cursor is moved forward.

That is the behavior I want.

However, when the extmark is multi-line, after issuing the `<M-Right>` key:
- all the text of the current line is cleared.
- the cursor is moved to begining of the current line.
- the extmark is not cleared and I can accept extmark words one by one

I want to keep the working features working as before, and handle correctly the multi-line extmarks.

I want that if the extmark is multi-line, the cursor moves like I want above.

Give me the code of the `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function that implements this behavior.

To implement the desired behavior for accepting suggestions word by word, especially handling multi-line extmarks, you can modify the `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function as follows:

```lua
function M.accept_suggestion_word()
  if not _G.current_suggestion or _G.current_suggestion == "" then
    return
  end

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
  local col = position[2]

  -- Find the first word in the suggestion
  local first_word, rest_of_suggestion = _G.current_suggestion:match("^(%%S+)(.*)")

  if not first_word then
    return
  end

  -- Insert the first word at the current cursor position
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(current_buf, row, col, row, col, { first_word })

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the inserted word
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + 1, col + #first_word })

  -- Update the current suggestion to remove the accepted word
  _G.current_suggestion = rest_of_suggestion:match("^%%s*(.*)")

  -- If the extmark is multi-line, clear the current line and move the cursor to the beginning
  if _G.num_lines_inserted > 0 then
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row, row + 1, false, { "" })
    vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + 1, 0 })
  end

  -- Clear the current extmark and set a new one with the updated suggestion
  M.clear_suggestion()
  if _G.current_suggestion and _G.current_suggestion ~= "" then
    M.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
  end
end
```

### Explanation:

1. **Word Extraction**: The function extracts the first word from the current suggestion using pattern matching.

2. **Text Insertion**: The first word is inserted at the current cursor position.

3. **Cursor Movement**: The cursor is moved to the end of the inserted word.

4. **Multi-line Handling**: If the extmark is multi-line (`_G.num_lines_inserted > 0`), the current line is cleared, and the cursor is moved to the beginning of the line.

5. **Suggestion Update**: The current suggestion is updated to remove the accepted word, and the extmark is updated accordingly.

This implementation should provide the desired behavior for both single-line and multi-line suggestions.
