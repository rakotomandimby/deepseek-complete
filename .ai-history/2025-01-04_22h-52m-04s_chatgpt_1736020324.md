# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.

It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.

The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).

The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

With the existing code, after I type `<M-PageDown>`:
- The initial cursor position is reported in the log file.
- The cursor is placed at the end of the line.
- The new cursor position is reported in the log file: but it is the same as the initial cursor position.
- I see "Generated suggestion: ..." in the log file.
- The suggestion doens't appear in the buffer: this is the problem to solve.
- There is no error message.

It is suspicious that the cursor position is reported to be the same as the initial cursor position, because I see the cursor position change in the buffer after I type `<M-PageDown>`

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the suggestion appear in the buffer.
If some debug is needed, tell me where to put the log instructions.



# This is gpt-4o-mini answer (1k in, 0k out)

To make the inline suggestion appear in the buffer as intended, we need to ensure that the cursor is correctly moved to the end of the line before the suggestion is displayed. The issue you're encountering, where the cursor position is reported to be the same before and after the `<M-PageDown>` key sequence, suggests that the cursor movement is not being executed as expected.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure Cursor Movement**: The cursor movement command (`<Esc>A`) is intended to move the cursor to the end of the line in insert mode. However, it seems that the cursor position is not being updated correctly before generating the suggestion. We need to ensure that the cursor position is updated after the movement command is executed.

2. **Add Debug Logging**: We can add additional logging to track the cursor position before and after the movement command to confirm that it is being executed correctly.

### Updated Code

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `show_suggestion` function in `plugin/init.lua` to ensure the suggestion appears correctly:

```lua
local function show_suggestion()
  clear_suggestion()

  -- Get the current buffer and cursor position *BEFORE* moving the cursor
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local current_cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0) -- Get cursor pos before moving

  -- Log the initial cursor position
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Cursor position before <Esc>A: " .. vim.inspect(current_cursor_pos))

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the line
  vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes("<Esc>A", true, false, true), 'i', true)

  -- Wait for the cursor to move
  vim.cmd("sleep 100m") -- Sleep for a short duration to allow cursor movement

  -- Get the new cursor position after moving
  current_cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0) -- Get cursor pos after moving
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Cursor position after <Esc>A: " .. vim.inspect(current_cursor_pos))

  -- Generate a random sentence
  local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Generated suggestion: " .. suggestion)

  -- Create a namespace for our extmarks
  local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

  _G.current_extmarks = {}

  -- Set the extmark *at the current cursor position*
  local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, current_cursor_pos[1] - 1, current_cursor_pos[2] - 1, {
    virt_text = { { suggestion, "InlineSuggestion" } },
    virt_text_pos = 'eol', -- Change to 'eol' to push down the lines below
  })
  table.insert(_G.current_extmarks, { ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id })
end
```

### Key Changes Made

1. **Sleep Command**: Added `vim.cmd("sleep 100m")` to allow a brief pause for the cursor movement to take effect before checking the new cursor position. This ensures that the cursor has moved to the end of the line.

2. **Change `virt_text_pos`**: Changed `virt_text_pos` to `'eol'` to ensure that the suggestion text appears at the end of the line and pushes down the lines below it, rather than overlapping.

### Additional Debugging

- You can add more logging statements if needed, especially around the cursor movement and extmark creation, to ensure that the values are as expected.
- If the suggestion still does not appear, check the Neovim logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with the extmark creation.

By implementing these changes, the inline suggestion should now appear correctly in the buffer when you trigger it with `<M-PageDown>`.
