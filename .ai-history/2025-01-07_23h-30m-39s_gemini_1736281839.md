# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.

Problem: 
- The DeepSeek API response is a multiline string 
- The extmark covers the lines below the cursor position

Tell me what modifications I need to make 
- the first line of the suggestion to be displayed on the same line as the cursor
- If the suggestion is more thant one line: make the remaining suggestion lines to push down the text below the cursor in order to avoid the overlap.

The issue is that you're setting the extmarks starting from the current cursor position, which causes overlapping if the suggestion is multiline.  You need to insert the suggestion *after* the current line's text and push subsequent lines down.  This requires manipulating the buffer content directly.

Here's the modified `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` file:

```lua
-- lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
local M = {}

-- ... (Existing functions: log, remove_markdown_delimiters, get_text_before_cursor, etc.)

function M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
  suggestion = M.remove_markdown_delimiters(suggestion)
  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1
  local col = position[2]

  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)

  -- Clear existing extmarks
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Insert the suggestion into the buffer *after* the current line's text
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row, row, false, {
      vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(current_buf, row, row + 1, false)[1] .. lines[1]
  })


  -- Add extmark for the first line (which is now part of the buffer)
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(current_buf, _G.ns_id, row, col, {
    virt_text = {{lines[1], "Comment"}},
    hl_mode = 'combine',
    end_col = col + #lines[1], -- Highlight the entire first line of the suggestion
  })


  -- Insert the remaining lines and add extmarks
  for i = 2, #lines do
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + i -1, row + i - 1, false, {lines[i]}) -- Insert lines below
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(current_buf, _G.ns_id, row + i - 1, 0, {
      virt_text = {{lines[i], "Comment"}},
      hl_mode = 'combine',
      end_col = #lines[i], -- Highlight the entire line
    })
  end

end


return M
```

Key changes:

1. **Insert into buffer:** The code now inserts the suggestion directly into the buffer using `nvim_buf_set_lines`.  The first line of the suggestion is appended to the current line. Subsequent lines are inserted below, pushing the existing content down.

2. **Extmark Adjustment:** The extmark for the first line is set to highlight from the original cursor position to the end of the inserted suggestion on that line.  Extmarks for subsequent lines highlight the entire inserted line.

3. **Simplified Line Insertion:** The code is simplified to directly insert lines using `nvim_buf_set_lines` in a loop, making it cleaner and more efficient.



No changes are required in `plugin/init.lua`.  This modification to `set_suggestion_extmark` should achieve the desired behavior of inlining the first line and pushing subsequent lines down without overlap.  This approach avoids the complexity of virtual text positioning for multiline suggestions and provides a more robust solution.
