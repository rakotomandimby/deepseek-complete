# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

When the user types fast, the suggestion may only be triggered if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.
That is the behavior I want.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types `<M-ESC>` key, a suggestion is triggered and the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
But if the user continues typing, the suggestion must be cleared.
If the types `<M-ESC>` key again, the suggestion must be triggered and the new suggestion will be displayed when it arrives.
This must be repeatable any number of times.

Note that inserting suggestions is a text modification, so be careful to not delete the suggestion when inserting it.

Tell me the modifications I need to make the suggestion clearing .

To implement the desired behavior for clearing suggestions when the user types, you will need to make a few modifications to your existing code. Below are the steps and the necessary code changes to achieve this functionality.

### Step 1: Modify the `clear_suggestion` function

You need to ensure that the `clear_suggestion` function is called whenever the user types. This can be done by creating an `InsertCharPre` autocommand that triggers the `clear_suggestion` function.

### Step 2: Update the `plugin/init.lua` file

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `plugin/init.lua` file to include the necessary changes:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

local api_call_in_progress = false
local last_api_call_time = 0

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

-- Default keymappings
local default_opts = {
  deepseek_api_key = os.getenv("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"),
  suggest_lines_keymap = "<M-ESC>",
  accept_all_keymap = "<M-PageDown>",
  accept_line_keymap = "<M-Down>",
  debounce_time = 1000,
}

local function clear_suggestion()
  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Remove the inserted lines if any
  if _G.num_lines_inserted and _G.num_lines_inserted > 0 then
    local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
    local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + 1, row + 1 + _G.num_lines_inserted, false, {}) -- remove the inserted lines
    _G.num_lines_inserted = 0 -- Reset after removing lines
  end
end

-- Read user configuration
local user_opts = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", default_opts, vim.g.rktmb_deepseek_complete_opts or {})

local function process_deepseek_response(response)
  vim.schedule(function()  -- Use vim.schedule to run this in the main thread
    local response_body = vim.fn.json_decode(response.body)
    if response_body.choices and #response_body.choices > 0 then
      clear_suggestion()  -- Clear previous suggestions
      local choice = response_body.choices[1]
      local suggestion = choice.message.content
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
      _G.current_suggestion = suggestion
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("\n\nSuggestion from DeepSeek API:")
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(suggestion)
    end
  end)
end

_G.suggest = function()
  local now = vim.loop.hrtime() / 1000000
  if api_call_in_progress or (now - last_api_call_time < user_opts.debounce_time) then
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("API call in progress or too recent, skipping.")
    return
  end

  api_call_in_progress = true
  last_api_call_time = now
  local deepseek_request_body = {
    model = "deepseek-chat",
    echo = false,
    frequency_penalty = 0,
    max_tokens = 4096,
    presence_penalty = 0,
    stop = nil,
    stream = false,
    stream_options = nil,
    temperature = 1,
    top_p = 1,
    messages = rktmb_deepseek_complete.build_messages_table(
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_before_cursor(),
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_after_cursor(),
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.get_text_before_cursor_line()
    )
  }

  -- Asynchronously make the POST request
  curl.post('https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions', {
    body = vim.fn.json_encode(deepseek_request_body),
    headers = {
      ["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
      ["Accept"] = "application/json",
      ["Authorization"] = "Bearer " .. user_opts.deepseek_api_key
    },
    callback = function(response)
      api_call_in_progress = false -- Reset the flag after receiving the response
      process_deepseek_response(response)
    end
  })
end

-- Clear suggestion when leaving insert mode
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end
})

-- Clear suggestion when typing
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertCharPre", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end
})

-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Uncomment these if you want to use them
-- vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_all_keymap,    "<Cmd>lua accept_the_whole_suggestion()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
-- vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_line_keymap,   "<Cmd>lua accept_one_suggestion_line()<CR>",  { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **InsertCharPre Autocommand**: 
   - This autocommand is triggered before a character is inserted in insert mode. It calls the `clear_suggestion` function to remove any existing suggestions whenever the user types.

2. **Maintaining Suggestion Logic**: 
   - The existing logic for handling suggestions remains intact. The `suggest()` function is still called when the user presses `<M-ESC>` or the space key, and the suggestions are displayed as extmarks.

3. **Debouncing Logic**: 
   - The debounce logic ensures that suggestions are not triggered too frequently, maintaining a smooth user experience.

With these modifications, your plugin will now clear suggestions when the user types, allowing for a more dynamic and responsive inline suggestion experience.
