# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode, if I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
then the plugin should suggest to complete the current word with a random sentence 
picked from the list of sentences. The suggestion text should appear in grey.

The problem is when I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`, the completion actually written in the buffer and doesn't behave as an inline suggestion.

I want it to be an inline suggestion, not a typed text.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make it an inline suggestion.

The issue lies in how you're using the `vim.fn.complete()` function.  This function is designed for *inserting* completions, not displaying them as inline suggestions.  Neovim's `complete()` function doesn't have a direct mechanism for inline suggestions in the way you're envisioning.  You need to use the `nvim_buf_set_extmark()` function combined with the `in-completion-item` highlight group to achieve this effect.

Here's the modified `plugin/init.lua` that implements inline suggestions:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

_G.completion_handler = nil
_G.current_extmark = nil -- Store the extmark ID

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertEnter", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        _G.completion_handler = function()
            local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
            local current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[2]
            local current_word = vim.fn.expand("<cword>")

            local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()

            -- Clear previous suggestion if any
            if _G.current_extmark then
                vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, _G.current_extmark.ns, _G.current_extmark.id)
                _G.current_extmark = nil
            end


            local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace("rktmb-deepseek-complete-ns")
            local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1] - 1, current_col, {
                virt_text = {{suggestion, "in-completion-item"}},
                virt_text_pos = "overlay",
                hl_mode = "combine" -- Important for proper highlighting
            })

            _G.current_extmark = {ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id}

        end

        vim.keymap.set("i", "<M-PageDown>", function()
            vim.defer_fn(_G.completion_handler, 0)
            return ""
        end, { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })
    end
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        vim.keymap.del("i", "<M-PageDown>")
        _G.completion_handler = nil

        -- Clear the suggestion on InsertLeave
        if _G.current_extmark then
            vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, _G.current_extmark.ns, _G.current_extmark.id)
            _G.current_extmark = nil
        end
    end
})

```

Key changes:

* **`nvim_buf_set_extmark()`:** This function is used to create virtual text (the suggestion) at the cursor position.  The `virt_text` property holds the text and highlight group.  `virt_text_pos = "overlay"` ensures the text is displayed as an overlay. `hl_mode = "combine"` allows the highlight group to be combined with existing highlights.
* **`in-completion-item`:** This built-in highlight group provides the grayed-out appearance for suggestions.
* **Namespace:** A namespace (`rktmb-deepseek-complete-ns`) is created to manage the extmark. This is crucial for cleanup.
* **Storing Extmark ID:** The extmark ID is stored in `_G.current_extmark` so it can be removed later.
* **Clearing the Suggestion:** The `InsertLeave` autocommand now clears the suggestion using `nvim_buf_del_extmark()` and the stored ID.  This prevents lingering suggestions.  The suggestion is also cleared before displaying a new one.


With these changes, pressing `<M-PageDown>` in insert mode will display the random sentence as a grayed-out inline suggestion.  The suggestion won't be inserted until you explicitly accept it (which you'll need to implement in a later step).  This approach is much more aligned with how modern completion plugins handle suggestions.
