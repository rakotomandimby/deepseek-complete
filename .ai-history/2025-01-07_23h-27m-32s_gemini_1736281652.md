# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.

Problem: 
- The DeepSeek API response is a multiline string 
- The extmark covers the lines below the cursor position

Tell me what modifications I need the multiline suggestion to push down the text below the cursor in order to avoid the overlap.

The issue you're encountering is due to extmarks being displayed *over* existing text.  You're setting the extmarks at the cursor position, so the suggestion overlays the text that's already there.  To make the suggestion push the existing text down, you need to actually insert the suggestion into the buffer and then use extmarks to style it as a suggestion.  This will cause the buffer content to shift appropriately.

Here's the modified `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` and `plugin/init.lua` to achieve this:

```lua
-- lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
-- ... (Existing code remains the same) ...

function M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
  suggestion = M.remove_markdown_delimiters(suggestion)

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1
  local col = position[2]

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)

  -- Clear existing extmarks and inserted text
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Insert the suggestion text into the buffer
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row, row, false, lines)


  local start_row = row
  local end_row = row + #lines -1

    -- Add extmarks to highlight the inserted text
  for i = 1, #lines do
      local current_row = start_row + i - 1
      local line_len = string.len(lines[i])
      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(current_buf, _G.ns_id, current_row, 0, {
          end_col = line_len,  -- Highlight the whole line
          virt_text = {}, -- No need for virtual text anymore
          hl_group = "Comment", -- Or any highlight group you prefer
      })
  end

end

-- ... (Rest of the code remains the same) ...
```

```lua
-- plugin/init.lua
-- ... (Other code remains the same) ...

_G.suggest = function()
    -- ... (Existing code) ...
end

-- ... (Other code remains the same) ...
```


Key changes:

1. **Insert Lines:**  In `M.set_suggestion_extmark`, we now use `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines` to insert the suggestion lines into the buffer at the cursor position. This pushes the existing text down.

2. **Highlight Inserted Text:** After inserting, we iterate through the inserted lines and apply extmarks to them. We use `hl_group` to style the inserted text as a suggestion (e.g., using the "Comment" highlight group).  We no longer need `virt_text` because the text is now part of the buffer.

3. **Clear Previous Suggestions:**  We clear both the extmarks *and* the previously inserted suggestion text before inserting a new suggestion. This prevents accumulating old suggestions in the buffer.


With these changes, the suggested code will be inserted into the buffer, pushing the subsequent text down, and the inserted text will be highlighted as a suggestion. This provides a much cleaner inline suggestion experience.
