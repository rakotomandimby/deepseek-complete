# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

I wrote `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

But when I type `<M-PageDown>`, the inline suggestion is not splat into multiple lines.
I just see the entire sentence in one line and a `^@` in the place of the newline character.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion to display the sentence on multiple lines and push down the lines below.

The issue lies in how you're using `virt_text`.  `virt_text` displays text visually *after* the given position, but it doesn't actually modify the buffer content or move the cursor to a new line.  Newline characters within the `virt_text` string are represented literally (often as `^@`), not as actual newlines.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua` using the `complete-items` strategy, which is better suited for multi-line suggestions:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  local current_row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]

  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_row, #current_line })

  local sentence = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local lines = vim.split(sentence, "\n", true)

  local opts = {
    kind = "plaintext",
    menu = "[Random]",  -- Optional: Add a menu label
  }

    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_row - 1, #current_line, {virt_text = {{' ', "Normal"}}, virt_text_pos='overlay'}) -- trick to push down the lines below

  vim.fn.complete(0, {
      { word = lines[1], opts = opts }, -- First line as the main completion item
      unpack(vim.tbl_map(function(line)
          return { word = line, opts = opts }
      end, vim.list_slice(lines, 2))) -- Subsequent lines as additional items
  })


  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", { clear = true })
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
    group = augroup_id,
    buffer = 0,
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id)
      vim.cmd [[pumhide]] -- Hide the popup menu when typing starts
    end,
  })

end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
  end,
})

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageDown>", "<Cmd>lua suggest_random_sentence()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```


Key Changes and Explanations:

1. **Using `vim.fn.complete()`:** This function is designed for presenting completion suggestions, including multi-line ones.  It handles the display and selection logic.

2. **Formatting for `complete()`:** The suggestions are provided as a table of tables, where each inner table represents a completion item with its `word` (the text to insert) and optional `opts`.

3. **Handling Multi-line Suggestions:** The first line of the sentence is used as the primary `word`. Subsequent lines are added as separate completion items.  This allows the completion menu to display them correctly.

4. **Clearing the Popup:** The `pumhide` command is added to the `TextChangedI` autocommand to ensure the completion popup disappears when the user starts typing.

5. **Pushing down lines below:** The `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark` call with an empty virtual text is a trick to push down the lines below.

With these changes, triggering `<M-PageDown>` will present the random sentence as a multi-line suggestion in the completion popup, pushing the subsequent lines down appropriately.  Typing will dismiss the popup.



Now, the completion menu will show the multi-line suggestion correctly, and typing will dismiss it as expected.  This approach is much cleaner and more robust than trying to manipulate `virt_text` directly for multi-line suggestions.
