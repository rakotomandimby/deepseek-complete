# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be a code completion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.

That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Suggest a completion from a random sentence when triggered.

I want that when I am in a buffer, if I issue the command `:DeepSeekComplete`,
then the plugin should suggest a completion from the random sentence generator.

Tell me what code to put in what file in order to achieve that.




# This is gpt-4o-mini answer (0k in, 0k out)

To achieve the functionality you described, we will need to modify the `plugin/init.lua` file to define the command `:DeepSeekComplete` and use the `generate_sentence()` function from `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` to suggest a completion. Below are the complete contents of both files after the necessary modifications.

### Updated `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`

This file remains unchanged since it already contains the `generate_sentence()` function.

```lua
-- Initialize a module
local M = {}

-- Function to generate a random sentence
function M.generate_sentence()
  local sentences = {
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.",
    "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.",
    "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump.",
    "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.",
    "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump.",
    "What do you get if you multiply six by nine.",
    "If six is nine, what do you get?",
    "If six is nine, what do you get?",
    "I'm not a number, I'm a free man.",
    "I'm not a number, I'm a free man.",
    "Hey, I'm a free man. What do you get if you multiply six by nine?",
    "Hey, I'm a free man. What do you get if you multiply six by nine?",
  }
  return sentences[math.random(#sentences)]
end

return M
```

### New `plugin/init.lua`

Here is the complete content for `plugin/init.lua`, which defines the `:DeepSeekComplete` command.

```lua
-- Load the random sentence generator module
local deepseek = require('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

-- Function to suggest a completion
local function suggest_completion()
  local sentence = deepseek.generate_sentence()
  -- Display the random sentence in a message
  vim.api.nvim_out_write("Suggested Completion: " .. sentence .. "\n")
end

-- Create a command to trigger the completion suggestion
vim.api.nvim_create_user_command('DeepSeekComplete', suggest_completion, {})
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Loading the Module**: The `require('rktmb-deepseek-complete')` line loads the module that contains the `generate_sentence()` function.

2. **Defining the Suggestion Function**: The `suggest_completion` function calls `generate_sentence()` to get a random sentence and then uses `vim.api.nvim_out_write` to display it in the Neovim command line.

3. **Creating the Command**: The `vim.api.nvim_create_user_command` function creates a new command `:DeepSeekComplete` that, when executed, will call the `suggest_completion` function.

### Usage

1. Save the changes to both files.
2. Open Neovim and load your plugin.
3. In any buffer, type `:DeepSeekComplete` and press Enter. You should see a random sentence suggested in the command line.

This setup will allow you to generate and display random sentences as completions in Neovim. Let me know if you need further modifications or additional features!
