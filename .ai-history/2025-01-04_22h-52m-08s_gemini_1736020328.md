# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.

It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.

The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).

The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

With the existing code, after I type `<M-PageDown>`:
- The initial cursor position is reported in the log file.
- The cursor is placed at the end of the line.
- The new cursor position is reported in the log file: but it is the same as the initial cursor position.
- I see "Generated suggestion: ..." in the log file.
- The suggestion doens't appear in the buffer: this is the problem to solve.
- There is no error message.

It is suspicious that the cursor position is reported to be the same as the initial cursor position, because I see the cursor position change in the buffer after I type `<M-PageDown>`

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the suggestion appear in the buffer.
If some debug is needed, tell me where to put the log instructions.



# This is gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp answer (1k in, 1k out)

The main issue lies in how you're getting the cursor position *after* sending `<Esc>A`.  You're using `vim.api.nvim_feedkeys()` asynchronously (the last argument `true`). This means the function returns *before* the keys are actually processed and the cursor moves.  Therefore, you're capturing the initial cursor position twice.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

-- Define the highlight group for the suggestion text
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "InlineSuggestion", { fg = "#808080", bg = "NONE" })

-- Global variables to keep track of extmarks
_G.current_extmarks = nil

-- Function to clear the current suggestion
local function clear_suggestion()
  if _G.current_extmarks then
    for _, extmark in pairs(_G.current_extmarks) do
      vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, extmark.ns, extmark.id)
    end
    _G.current_extmarks = nil
  end
end

-- Function to show the suggestion when triggered
local function show_suggestion()
  clear_suggestion()

  -- Get the current buffer and cursor position *BEFORE* moving the cursor
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local current_cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0) -- Get cursor pos before moving

  -- adding some debug logs
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Cursor position before <Esc>A: " .. vim.inspect(current_cursor_pos))

  -- Use a callback to ensure the cursor position is retrieved *after* the keys are processed
  vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes("<Esc>A", true, false, true), 'n', false, function()
    -- adding some debug logs *inside the callback*
    local current_cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0) -- Get cursor pos after moving
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Cursor position after <Esc>A: " .. vim.inspect(current_cursor_pos))

    -- Generate a random sentence
    local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Generated suggestion: " .. suggestion)

    -- Create a namespace for our extmarks
    local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

    _G.current_extmarks = {}

    -- Set the extmark *at the current cursor position*
    local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, current_cursor_pos[1] - 1, current_cursor_pos[2], {
      virt_text = { { suggestion, "InlineSuggestion" } },
      virt_text_pos = 'overlay',
    })
    table.insert(_G.current_extmarks, { ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id })

    -- Return to insert mode
    vim.api.nvim_feedkeys("a", 'n', false)
  end)
end


-- Map <M-PageDown> to show_suggestion in insert mode
vim.keymap.set('i', '<M-PageDown>', show_suggestion, { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when typing
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when leaving insert mode
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})
```

Key Changes:

1. **Callback for `nvim_feedkeys`:** The code now uses the fourth argument of `nvim_feedkeys` - a callback function. This function is executed *after* the keys `<Esc>A` are processed, ensuring the correct cursor position is retrieved.  The logging and extmark placement now happen inside this callback.

2. **Return to Insert Mode:**  After placing the extmark, the code now uses `vim.api.nvim_feedkeys("a", 'n', false)` to return the user to insert mode.

3. **Corrected column index:** The column index for the extmark was off by one.  It should be `current_cursor_pos[2]` (not `current_cursor_pos[2] - 1`) because `<Esc>A` already moves the cursor to the end of the line.


With these changes, the suggestion should appear correctly, and the logs will reflect the accurate cursor position after moving to the end of the line.
