# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.
If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion disappears.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears, again and again.

That is the desired behavior.

## Step 3: Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.

I want to transform the inline suggestion into regular text because I like that suggested sentence.
I want that if I issue the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence, the suggestion is transformed into regular text.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion to be transformed into regular text with the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence.

local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

  local lines = vim.split(sentence, "\n", true)

  local virt_lines = {}
  for _, line in ipairs(lines) do
    table.insert(virt_lines, { { line, "Comment" } })
  end

  local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_row - 1, 0, {
    virt_lines = virt_lines,
    virt_lines_above = false,

  })

  -- Store the extmark ID and the suggested lines for later use
  _G.current_extmark = { id = extmark_id, lines = lines }


  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", { clear = true })

      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id)
    end
  })
end

_G.accept_suggestion = function()
  if _G.current_extmark then
    local row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]
    vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, ns_id, _G.current_extmark.id)
    for _, line in ipairs(_G.current_extmark.lines) do

      row = row + 1
    end
      _G.current_extmark = nil
  end
end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
    _G.current_extmark = nil -- Clear the stored extmark data when leaving insert mode
  end
})

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageDown>", "<Cmd>lua suggest_random_sentence()<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageUp>", "<Cmd>lua accept_suggestion()<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})

```

Key changes:

1. **Store Suggestion Data:** The `suggest_random_sentence` function now stores the `extmark_id` and the generated `lines` in a global variable `_G.current_extmark`.  This allows us to access the suggestion data later when the user wants to accept it.  It's important to clear this variable when the suggestion is deleted (either by typing or leaving insert mode).

2. **`accept_suggestion` Function:** This new function is called when `<M-PageUp>` is pressed. It checks if `_G.current_extmark` exists (meaning a suggestion is active). If so, it deletes the extmark and inserts the stored lines as real text at the correct position.

3. **Clear Stored Data:**  The `_G.current_extmark` variable is cleared in the autocmd callbacks for `TextChangedI`, `InsertLeave`, ensuring that we don't try to accept a stale suggestion.

4. **`<M-PageUp>` Mapping:** A new keymap is created in insert mode to call the `accept_suggestion` function.


With these changes, pressing `<M-PageDown>` will show the suggestion, and pressing `<M-PageUp>` will convert it to real text. Continuing to type after `<M-PageDown>` will dismiss the suggestion as before.
