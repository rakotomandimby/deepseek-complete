# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

I wrote `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

But when I type `<M-PageDown>`, the inline suggestion appears as just one line with a `^@` in the place of the newline character.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion display on multiple lines and push down the lines below.

**Analysis:**

The issue you're experiencing stems from how `virt_text` works in Neovim. Let's break down what's happening:

1. **`virt_text` Limitations:**
   - `virt_text` is designed for inline annotations.
   - It does not support multi-line text that pushes down existing lines.
   - When you include newline characters (`\n`) in `virt_text`, they are rendered as control characters (like `^@`), not as actual line breaks.

2. **Your Current Implementation:**
   - You're splitting the sentence into lines and trying to include newline characters in `virt_text`.
   - Since `virt_text` doesn't handle newlines as expected, it displays the entire text on a single line, with `^@` representing the newline characters.

**Solution:**

To achieve your goal of displaying multi-line inline suggestions that push down the lines below, you should use the `virt_lines` feature introduced in **Neovim 0.9**.

- **`virt_lines`:**
  - Allows you to add virtual lines in the buffer that are not part of the actual file content.
  - These lines can be displayed above or below a specified line.
  - They interact properly with the buffer, pushing down existing lines.

**Here's how you can modify your code:**

1. **Update to Neovim 0.9 or Later (if you haven't already):**
   - Ensure that you're using a version of Neovim that supports `virt_lines`.

2. **Modify the `suggest_random_sentence` Function:**

```lua
_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  local current_row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]

  -- Ensure the cursor is at the end of the current line
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {current_row, #current_line})

  -- Generate the random sentence
  local sentence = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local lines = vim.split(sentence, "\n", true)

  -- Construct virt_lines with proper formatting
  local virt_lines = {}
  for _, line in ipairs(lines) do
    table.insert(virt_lines, { { line, "Comment" } }) -- Use "Comment" highlight group for grey text
  end

  -- Set the extmark with virt_lines
  local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_row - 1, 0, {
    virt_lines = virt_lines,
    virt_lines_above = false, -- Place the virtual lines below the current line
    hl_mode = 'combine' -- Combine with existing text highlighting
  })

  -- Clear the suggestion on text change or insert leave
  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", { clear = true })
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "TextChangedI", "InsertLeave" }, {
    group = augroup_id,
    buffer = 0,
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, ns_id, extmark_id)
      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id)
    end
  })
end
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cursor Positioning:**
  - We ensure the cursor is at the end of the current line before inserting the suggestion.

- **Using `virt_lines`:**
  - We create a `virt_lines` table, where each entry represents a virtual line.
  - Each line is a list of chunks; each chunk is a table with the text and the highlight group.

- **Setting the Extmark:**
  - We use `nvim_buf_set_extmark` with `virt_lines` to display the suggestion.
  - `virt_lines_above = false` places the virtual lines below the current line.
  - `hl_mode = 'combine'` ensures that the highlighting of the virtual lines is combined with any existing text highlighting.

- **Clearing the Suggestion:**
  - We create an autocmd group to clear the extmark when the buffer changes (e.g., the user types something) or when insert mode is exited.
  - This ensures the suggestion disappears as expected when the user resumes typing.

**Testing the Updated Code:**

1. **Reload the Plugin:**
   - After updating the code, reload the plugin or restart Neovim to ensure the changes take effect.

2. **Trigger the Suggestion:**
   - Enter Insert mode.
   - Type some text or navigate to where you want the suggestion.
   - Press `<M-PageDown>` to trigger the suggestion.

3. **Observe the Behavior:**
   - The multi-line suggestion should appear in grey text below your current line.
   - The lines below should be pushed down appropriately.
   - If you start typing, the suggestion should disappear.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Neovim Version Compatibility:**
  - Confirm your Neovim version by running `:version` in Neovim.
  - If you have a version earlier than 0.9, consider updating to access `virt_lines`.

- **Highlight Group Customization:**
  - Currently, the suggestion uses the "Comment" highlight group for grey text.
  - You can define a custom highlight group if you want to adjust the appearance.
    ```lua
    vim.cmd('highlight MySuggestionHighlight guifg=#808080')
    -- Then use "MySuggestionHighlight" in place of "Comment"
    ```
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - Ensure that any errors in generating the sentence are properly handled.
  - You can enhance `generate_sentence` to handle edge cases or exceptions.

**Why `virt_text` Didn't Work:**

- **Inline Only:**
  - `virt_text` displays text inline at the position specified.
  - It does not support line breaks or multi-line display.

- **Control Characters:**
  - Newline characters in `virt_text` are rendered as control characters (e.g., `^@`), not as actual newlines.
  - This causes the entire text to appear on one line with symbols instead of breaking into multiple lines.

**Using `virt_lines`:**

- **Designed for Multi-line Annotations:**
  - `virt_lines` is intended for situations where you need to display additional lines without altering the buffer content.

- **Pushes Down Existing Text:**
  - Virtual lines inserted below (`virt_lines_above = false`) will push down the subsequent lines in the buffer visually.

- **Does Not Modify Buffer Content:**
  - The actual content of the file remains unchanged, which is ideal for non-intrusive suggestions.

**Conclusion:**

By utilizing `virt_lines`, you can effectively display multi-line inline suggestions that meet your requirements:

- **Multi-line Display:** The suggestion spans multiple lines as intended.
- **Pushes Down Text:** Existing lines are pushed down, preventing overlap.
- **Disappears on Typing:** The suggestion is cleared when the user types or exits insert mode.
- **Customizable Appearance:** You can adjust the highlight group to change the suggestion's appearance.

**Next Steps:**

- Implement the modified code.
- Test the functionality thoroughly.
- If you plan to proceed to the next steps (integrating with the DeepSeek API), ensure that the mechanism for displaying suggestions is solid.
