# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.

Problem: 
- The DeepSeek API response is a multiline string 
- The extmark covers the lines below the cursor position

Tell me what modifications I need to make 
- the first line of the suggestion to be displayed on the same line as the cursor
- If the suggestion is more thant one line: make the remaining suggestion lines to push down the text below the cursor in order to avoid the overlap.



# This is o1-preview answer (3k in, 6k out)

To achieve your desired behavior—displaying the first line of the suggestion inline with the cursor and pushing down the existing text for multiline suggestions—you'll need to make some modifications to your `set_suggestion_extmark` function.

Here's what we'll address:

1. **Display the first line of the suggestion on the same line as the cursor.**
2. **Push down the text below the cursor to avoid overlap when the suggestion spans multiple lines.**

---

### **Understanding the Limitation**

Before we proceed, it's important to understand that Neovim's virtual text and virtual lines (`virt_text` and `virt_lines` in extmarks) **do not modify the buffer's content**. They overlay text **on top of** existing buffer lines, which means they can't push down or reposition the actual content of the buffer.

If we need to push down the text to make room for the suggestions without overlap, **we have to modify the buffer** by inserting new lines.

---

### **Solution: Modify the Buffer to Insert Empty Lines**

Here's how you can achieve the desired behavior:

1. **Use `virt_text` to display the first line of the suggestion starting at the cursor position.**
2. **Insert empty lines into the buffer after the cursor line to accommodate the remaining suggestion lines.**
3. **Use `virt_text` on these empty lines to display the rest of the suggestion.**

This approach will ensure that the existing text in the buffer is pushed down, making room for the suggestion and avoiding any visual overlap.

### **Modified `set_suggestion_extmark` Function**

Here's the modified code for your `set_suggestion_extmark` function:

```lua
function M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
  -- Remove Markdown code block delimiters from the suggestion
  suggestion = M.remove_markdown_delimiters(suggestion)

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
  local col = position[2]

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)

  -- Clear existing extmarks
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Insert empty lines into the buffer if necessary
  if #lines > 1 then
    local num_lines_to_insert = #lines - 1
    -- Insert empty lines after current line
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + 1, row + 1, false, vim.fn['repeat']({' '}, num_lines_to_insert))
  end

  -- Now set the extmarks
  -- First line: virt_text on current line starting at cursor column
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(
    current_buf,
    _G.ns_id,
    row,
    col,
    {
      virt_text = { { lines[1], "Comment" } },
      hl_mode = 'combine',
    }
  )

  -- Remaining lines: virt_text on the inserted empty lines
  for i = 2, #lines do
    local extmark_row = row + i - 1 -- Adjust row for each line
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(
      current_buf,
      _G.ns_id,
      extmark_row,
      0,
      {
        virt_text = { { lines[i], "Comment" } },
        hl_mode = 'combine',
      }
    )
  end
end
```

**Explanation:**

- **Insert Empty Lines:**

  - We calculate the number of lines we need to insert (`num_lines_to_insert`), which is the total suggestion lines minus one (since the first line is on the current line).
  - We use `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines` to insert empty lines into the buffer after the current line. This pushes down the existing text, providing space for the suggestion.

- **Set Extmarks:**

  - For the **first line**, we use `virt_text` starting at the cursor's column on the same line (`row`).
  - For the **remaining lines**, we place `virt_text` at the beginning of each newly inserted empty line.

- **Highlighting:**

  - We set the highlight group to `"Comment"` for the suggestion text. You can change this to any highlight group you prefer.

---

### **Handling Buffer Modifications**

Since we are modifying the buffer by inserting new lines, we need to ensure that:

- **Undo History:** The insertions are properly recorded in the undo history, so the user can undo them if necessary.
- **Buffer State:** We handle any potential side effects of modifying the buffer, such as adjusting marks or handling concurrent edits.

---

### **Alternative Solution: Using Floating Windows (Without Modifying the Buffer)**

If you prefer **not to modify the buffer**, an alternative is to use a floating window to display the suggestion below the cursor. Floating windows can display content without affecting the buffer's content or layout.

Here's an example function to display the suggestion in a floating window:

```lua
function M.show_suggestion_floating_window(suggestion)
  local buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true) -- Create a scratch buffer

  -- Set the suggestion text into the buffer
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf, 0, -1, false, vim.split(suggestion, '\n'))

  -- Get window dimensions
  local width = math.max(20, math.floor(vim.o.columns * 0.4))
  local height = #vim.split(suggestion, '\n')

  -- Get cursor position
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1]
  local col = position[2]

  -- Calculate window position
  local win_opts = {
    relative = "cursor",
    row = 1,          -- Adjust as needed
    col = 0,
    width = width,
    height = height,
    style = "minimal",
    border = "rounded",
  }

  -- Create the floating window
  local win = vim.api.nvim_open_win(buf, false, win_opts)

  -- Optional: Close the window when leaving insert mode
  vim.cmd([[autocmd InsertLeave <buffer> ++once lua vim.api.nvim_win_close(]] .. win .. [[, true)]])
end
```

**Usage:**

- Replace your call to `set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)` with `show_suggestion_floating_window(suggestion)` when you receive the suggestion.

**Benefits:**

- **No buffer modification:** The buffer remains unchanged.
- **No overlap:** The floating window appears above the buffer content, avoiding any overlap.
- **Flexibility:** You can customize the appearance and behavior of the floating window.

**Drawbacks:**

- **Not inline:** The suggestion isn't inline with the text, which might not be the desired user experience.
- **Window management:** You'll need to handle the opening and closing of the floating window appropriately.

---

### **Important Considerations**

- **User Experience:** Modifying the buffer by inserting empty lines may disrupt the user's editing flow, especially if they decide not to accept the suggestion.
- **Suggestion Acceptance:** You'll need to implement a way for the user to accept or reject the suggestion. Upon acceptance, you can replace the extmarks with actual text in the buffer. If rejected, you should remove the extmarks and any inserted empty lines.

---

### **Updating Key Mappings for Acceptance**

To enhance the user experience, you can provide key mappings for accepting the suggestion:

```lua
-- Accept the whole suggestion
function _G.accept_suggestion()
  if not _G.current_suggestion then return end

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- 0-based indexing
  local col = position[2]

  -- Remove the extmarks
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Remove the inserted empty lines if any
  local lines = vim.split(_G.current_suggestion, '\n', true)
  if #lines > 1 then
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + 1, row + #lines, false, {})
  end

  -- Insert the suggestion into the buffer
  -- Replace the current line from cursor position to end
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(current_buf, row, row + 1, false)[1]
  local new_current_line = current_line:sub(1, col) .. lines[1]
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row, row + 1, false, { new_current_line })

  -- Insert the remaining lines
  if #lines > 1 then
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + 1, row + 1, false, vim.list_slice(lines, 2))
  end

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the inserted text
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + #lines, #lines[#lines] })
  
  -- Clear the current suggestion
  _G.current_suggestion = nil
end

-- Map a key to accept the suggestion
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-l>", "<Cmd>lua accept_suggestion()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

---

### **Final Notes**

- **Testing:** Make sure to thoroughly test the new behavior to ensure it works seamlessly with various file types and cursor positions.
- **Customization:** Feel free to adjust the key mappings and highlight groups to suit your preferences.
- **User Feedback:** Consider providing prompts or messages to the user when suggestions are available or when the buffer is modified.

---

By implementing these modifications, you'll achieve the desired behavior of displaying inline suggestions from the DeepSeek API, with the first line appearing on the same line as the cursor and subsequent lines pushing down the existing text to avoid overlap.
