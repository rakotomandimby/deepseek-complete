# Execute vim.schedule_wrap

In `./plugin/init.lua`, I never enter the `vim.schedule_wrap` function `vim.schedule_wrap(function() end)`.
In the logs, I see the `DeepSeek status: 200` message, but the `DeepSeek in the schedule_wrap` message is never displayed.

Analyze the code and tell me what I need to change to execute the `vim.schedule_wrap` function.

The issue lies within the asynchronous nature of `plenary.curl`.  The `callback` function provided to `curl.post` is executed when the HTTP request completes, but this happens *after* the current Lua code has finished executing.  `vim.schedule_wrap` schedules a function to be executed *after* the current Neovim event loop cycle completes.  Since the callback is invoked asynchronously, it's outside the initial event loop, and thus the scheduled function within the callback won't be executed immediately.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

local function process_deepseek_response(response)
  if response.status == 200 then
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("DeepSeek status: 200")
    -- Schedule the processing of the response
    vim.schedule(function()
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("DeepSeek in the schedule") -- Changed to just vim.schedule
      local body = vim.fn.json_decode(response.body)
      if body.choices and #body.choices > 0 then
        for _, choice in pairs(body.choices) do
          rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(choice.text)
          rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("===========================")
        end
      else
        rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("DeepSeek API returned no choices.")
      end
    end)
  else
    -- Log the error
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("DeepSeek API request failed with status: " .. tostring(response.status))
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Response body:\n" .. response.body)
  end
end

-- ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

The key change is replacing `vim.schedule_wrap` with just `vim.schedule`.  `vim.schedule` schedules the function to be run in the *next* event loop cycle. Since the callback is invoked asynchronously, using `vim.schedule` ensures that the processing of the response happens after the current event loop and the callback invocation, allowing the log message to be displayed correctly.  `vim.schedule_wrap` is unnecessary here and can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior with asynchronous operations.


`lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` remains unchanged.  Make sure you have a valid `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable set.  After making this change, the "DeepSeek in the schedule" message should appear in your log file.
