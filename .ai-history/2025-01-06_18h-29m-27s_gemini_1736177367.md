## Unpack is deprecated

The `unpack()` function used in `./plugin/init.lua` is deprecated in Lua 5.4.
I tried to use `table.unpack()` instead, but it breaks the code.

```
E5108: Error executing lua ....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:10: attempt to call field 'unpack' (a nil value)
stack traceback:
        ....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:10: in function 'suggest_random_sentence'
        [string ":lua"]:1: in main chunk
```

Tell me what I need to change in the code to make it compatible with Lua 5.4.

You're right, `unpack` is deprecated and removed in Lua 5.4.  It's been replaced by `table.unpack`, but you need to be careful how you use it since the return values are different.  `vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor()` returns a table with two numeric entries.  You were using `unpack` to directly assign those to `current_row` and `current_col`.  With `table.unpack`, you need to either assign the result to a table first, or use index-based access.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  local cursor_position_table = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local current_row = cursor_position_table[1] -- Direct access
  local current_col = cursor_position_table[2] -- Direct access

  -- Ensure the cursor is at the end of the current line
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {current_row, #current_line})

  cursor_position_table = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  current_row = cursor_position_table[1] -- Direct access again after setting cursor
  current_col = cursor_position_table[2] -- Direct access again after setting cursor

  -- ... (rest of the function remains the same)
end

_G.accept_suggestion = function()
  -- ... (no changes needed here)
end

-- ... (rest of the file remains the same)
```

Key changes:

* **Direct Access:** Instead of `cursor_position_table.unpack()`, we now use `cursor_position_table[1]` and `cursor_position_table[2]` to access the row and column respectively.  This is the most straightforward way to handle the change.

This revised code will work correctly with Lua 5.4 and later versions.  The error you were encountering was because `unpack` is no longer a function available in the global table or as a method on regular tables.  It was moved to the `table` library in Lua 5.2 and removed entirely in Lua 5.4.  By using direct access, we avoid the deprecated function altogether.


The `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` file remains unchanged.  Only the `plugin/init.lua` file needed the modification described above.  Make sure to replace your existing `plugin/init.lua` with the corrected version.
