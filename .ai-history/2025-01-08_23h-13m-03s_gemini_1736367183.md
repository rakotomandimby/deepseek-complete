# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

When the user types fast, the suggestion may only be triggered if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.
That is the behavior I want.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types `<M-ESC>` key, a suggestion is triggered and the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
But if the user continues typing, the suggestion must be cleared.
If the types `<M-ESC>` key again, the suggestion must be triggered and the new suggestion will be displayed when it arrives.
This must be repeatable any number of times.

Note that inserting suggestions is a text modification, so be careful to not delete the suggestion when inserting it.

Tell me the modifications I need to make the suggestion clearing .

The current code already handles most of the described functionality. The primary issue you're facing is clearing the suggestion correctly when the user continues typing after a suggestion is displayed.  The problem lies in the interaction between setting the extmarks and the autocmds.  Here's the adjusted code and explanation:

```lua
-- lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
-- ... (Existing code) ...

function M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
  -- ... (Existing code) ...

  -- Store the number of lines inserted in a buffer-local variable
  vim.b.num_lines_inserted = num_lines_to_insert
end

-- ... (Rest of the file)

-- plugin/init.lua
-- ... (Existing code) ...

local function clear_suggestion()
  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Retrieve the number of inserted lines from the buffer-local variable
  local num_lines_inserted = vim.b.num_lines_inserted

  -- Remove the inserted lines if any
  if num_lines_inserted and num_lines_inserted > 0 then
    local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
    local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + 1, row + 1 + num_lines_inserted, false, {}) -- remove the inserted lines
    vim.b.num_lines_inserted = 0 -- Reset after removing lines
  end

  _G.current_suggestion = nil -- Clear the current suggestion
end

-- ... (Existing code) ...

-- Use TextChangedI autocmd to clear suggestions on typing
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    if _G.current_suggestion then -- Only clear if a suggestion is present
      clear_suggestion()
    end
  end
})

-- Remove the InsertLeave autocmd as it's no longer needed
-- ... (Existing code) ...
```

Key Changes and Explanation:

1. **Buffer-Local Variable for Inserted Lines:** The `_G.num_lines_inserted` is changed to a buffer-local variable `vim.b.num_lines_inserted`. This prevents conflicts between multiple buffers and ensures the correct number of lines are removed.

2. **TextChangedI Autocmd:** The `InsertLeave` autocmd is replaced with a `TextChangedI` autocmd. This triggers the `clear_suggestion` function *whenever the text is changed in insert mode*.  This ensures the suggestion is cleared as the user types.

3. **Conditional Clearing in `TextChangedI`:** The `clear_suggestion` function is called only if `_G.current_suggestion` is not nil. This prevents unnecessary clearing when no suggestion is present.  This is crucial to avoid deleting text when the user is simply typing and no suggestion has been displayed.

4. **Clearing `_G.current_suggestion`:**  Inside `clear_suggestion()`, the global variable `_G.current_suggestion` is set to `nil`. This signals that the current suggestion has been cleared.

With these changes, the suggestion should be displayed correctly when triggered by `<M-ESC>` or space, and it should be cleared immediately when the user types anything afterward.  The debouncing logic will prevent excessive API calls, and the buffer-local variable ensures correct line removal.
