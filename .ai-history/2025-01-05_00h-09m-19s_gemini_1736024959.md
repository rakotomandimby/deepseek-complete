# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

I wrote `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

But when I type `<M-PageDown>`, the error message appears:

```
Attempt to call global 'suggest_random_sentence' (a nil value)
```

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to fix the issue.

The error "Attempt to call global 'suggest_random_sentence' (a nil value)" arises because the `suggest_random_sentence` function is defined within a local scope in your `plugin/init.lua` file.  It's not accessible globally as the keymap command expects.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

-- Define the function globally
_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()  -- Make this function global
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  local current_row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]

  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_row, #current_line })

  local sentence = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()

  local opts = {
    virt_text = { { sentence, "Comment" } },  -- Use "Comment" highlight group
    virt_text_pos = "overlay",
  }
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, vim.fn.nsID("rktmb-deepseek-complete"), current_row - 1, #current_line, opts)

  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", { clear = true })
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
    group = augroup_id,
    buffer = 0,
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, vim.fn.nsID("rktmb-deepseek-complete"), 0, -1)
      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id) -- Clean up the autocommand group
    end,
  })
end


vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageDown>", "<Cmd>lua suggest_random_sentence()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

Key Changes and Explanations:

1. **Global Function Definition:** The `suggest_random_sentence` function is now defined globally using `_G.suggest_random_sentence = function() ... end`. This makes it directly accessible to the Neovim command-line.  Alternatively, you could have kept it local and used `vim.cmd [[lua suggest_random_sentence()]]` in your keymap, but making it global is slightly more efficient.

2. **"Comment" Highlight Group:** The `virt_text` now uses the `"Comment"` highlight group. This will typically render the suggestion in a gray color, as is common for comments.  You can customize the `Comment` highlight group in your Neovim configuration if you want a different color.

3. **Clearing the Autocommand Group:** The `vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id)` line is added inside the `TextChangedI` autocommand's callback. This is crucial for cleaning up the autocommand after it has been triggered. Without this, you would create a new autocommand every time you typed, leading to performance issues.



With these changes, your `<M-PageDown>` mapping should work correctly, displaying the multi-line suggestion and clearing it when you type further.  The suggestions will push subsequent lines down due to the `virt_text_pos = "overlay"` setting.
