## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

When a suggestion is displayed, I want the user to be able to accept one word with the `<M-Right>` key.

As far as there is a suggestion, if the user presses `<M-Right>`, 
the first word of the suggestion is accepted and transformed into text at the same position.

Note: Gihub Copilot and Supermaven Neovim plugins do that.

The suggestion might be on the same line as the cursor or on a different line: we have to handle that case.

With the current implementation, when the user accepts a word, the word is inserted at the same position as the cursor but without space.

Tell me the steps to implement the word-by-word acceptance but with a space between the words.

To implement the word-by-word acceptance of suggestions with a space between the words in your Neovim plugin, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Modify the `accept_suggestion_word` function

You need to update the `accept_suggestion_word` function in `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` to ensure that when a word is accepted, it is inserted with a space before it if there is already text present at the cursor position.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the function:

```lua
function M.accept_suggestion_word()
    if _G.current_suggestion then
        -- Find the position of the next space or newline
        local next_space = _G.current_suggestion:find("%%s")
        local split_pos = next_space

        local word = ""
        if split_pos then
            word = _G.current_suggestion:sub(1, split_pos - 1)
        else
            word = _G.current_suggestion
        end

        -- Handle the case where there are leading newline characters
        local leading_newlines = _G.current_suggestion:match("^\n*")
        local num_newlines = leading_newlines and #leading_newlines or 0

        -- Move cursor down if there are leading newlines
        local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
        local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
        local row = position[1] - 1
        local col = position[2]

        if num_newlines > 0 then
            row = row + num_newlines
            col = 0
            vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + 1, col })
        end

        -- Insert a space before the word if there is already text at the cursor position
        local current_line = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(current_buf, row, row + 1, false)[1]
        if current_line and #current_line > 0 and col > 0 then
            word = " " .. word  -- Add a space before the word
        end

        -- Insert the accepted word into the buffer
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(current_buf, row, col, row, col, { word })

        -- Update cursor position after insertion
        col = col + #word
        vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + 1, col })

        -- Remove the accepted word and any leading whitespace/newlines from the suggestion
        local remaining_suggestion = _G.current_suggestion:sub(#leading_newlines + #word + 1)
        remaining_suggestion = remaining_suggestion:gsub("^%%s*", "")  -- Remove any leading whitespace

        _G.current_suggestion = remaining_suggestion

        -- Update the displayed suggestion (clear and redraw)
        M.clear_suggestion()
        if _G.current_suggestion and #_G.current_suggestion > 0 then
            M.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
        else
            _G.current_suggestion = nil -- Clear suggestion if no text left
        end
    end
end
```

### Step 2: Test the Implementation

1. **Load your Neovim plugin** and ensure that the changes are saved.
2. **Open a file** in Neovim and trigger a suggestion using your defined key mapping (e.g., `<M-ESC>`).
3. **Navigate to the suggestion** and press `<M-Right>` to accept the first word of the suggestion.
4. **Verify** that the word is inserted at the cursor position with a space before it if there is already text present.

### Step 3: Handle Edge Cases

- Ensure that if the cursor is at the beginning of a line, the word is inserted without a leading space.
- If the suggestion is on a different line, ensure that the cursor moves down appropriately and the word is inserted correctly.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have implemented the functionality to accept suggestions word by word with a space between the words in your Neovim plugin. Make sure to test thoroughly to handle various edge cases!
