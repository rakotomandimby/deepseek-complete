# Accept the first line of the suggestion and triger again

There is a keymap and a function to accept the first line of a suggestion: `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line()`.

It accepts the first line of the suggestion with the keymap `<M-Down>`.
When I accept the first line, the remaining suggestions lines are discarded and another suggestion is triggered based on that accepted line.

The problem is the accepted line goes one line above the current line of the cursor. I do not have that problem with the `_G.accept_the_whole_suggestion()` function.

Analyze the code, compare the functions and tell me the modifications I have to make to get the accepted line below the line of the cursor.

To ensure that the accepted line goes below the current line of the cursor when using the `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line()` function, you need to adjust the line number where the suggestion is inserted. 

### Current Implementation of `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line()`

Here is the relevant part of the `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line()` function:

```lua
local current_line = cursor_pos[1]

-- Insert the first line of the suggestion into the buffer
vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, current_line - 1, current_line - 1, false, { first_suggestion_line })

-- Move the cursor to the next line, after the inserted text
vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line, #first_suggestion_line })
```

### Problem

The line where the suggestion is inserted is currently set to `current_line - 1`, which means it is being inserted above the current line. 

### Solution

To insert the accepted line below the current line, you should change the line number in the `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines` function call from `current_line - 1` to `current_line`. 

### Modified Code

Hereâ€™s the modified version of the `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line()` function:

```lua
_G.accept_one_suggestion_line = function()
  if not _G.current_extmark_id or not _G.current_suggestion then
    -- No active suggestion to accept
    return
  end

  local bufnr = 0
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local current_line = cursor_pos[1]

  -- Get the first line of the suggestion
  local first_suggestion_line = _G.current_suggestion[1]

  -- Insert the first line of the suggestion into the buffer below the current line
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, current_line, current_line, false, { first_suggestion_line })

  -- Move the cursor to the next line, after the inserted text
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line + 1, 0 })  -- Move cursor to the next line

  -- Clear existing extmark and suggestion
  vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, _G.current_extmark_id)
  _G.current_extmark_id = nil
  _G.current_suggestion = nil

  -- Trigger a new suggestion
  vim.schedule(suggest) -- Use vim.schedule to avoid "recursive" lua call
end
```

### Summary of Changes

1. Change the line number in `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines` from `current_line - 1` to `current_line` to insert the suggestion below the current line.
2. Adjust the cursor position after inserting the line to `current_line + 1` to place the cursor on the new line.

With these modifications, the accepted line will be inserted below the current line of the cursor, resolving the issue you encountered.
