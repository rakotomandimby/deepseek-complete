# Accept the first line of the suggestion and triger again

There is a keymap and a function to accept the whole suggestion: `_G.accept_the_whole_suggestion`.

I want to accept the first line of the suggestion with a keymap `<M-Down>`.
I also want that when I accept the first line, the remaining suggestions lines are discarded and another suggestion is triggered based on that accepted line.

Tell me what I need to change in the code to achieve what I want.

# `M.get_buffer_content` is not returning anything

I use to open neovim with a glob pattern to open multiple files at once.
For example, I can open multiple files with `nvim *.lua **/*.lua`. 
Then I only visit one buffer.

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, I want to get the content of a given buffer.
But my function `M.get_buffer_content` is not returning anything.

The problem is that the `M.get_buffer_content` function only returns the content of a buffer I visited.
I need a way to get the content of a buffer even if I haven't visited it.

Analyze the code and tell me what I need to change to get the content of all buffers, even if I haven't visited them.

Okay, let's address both of your points:

## 1. Accepting the First Line and Triggering a New Suggestion

Here's the modified `plugin/init.lua` to accept the first line, clear the existing suggestion, and trigger a new one:

```lua
-- ... (rest of the code)

_G.accept_one_suggestion_line = function()
  if not _G.current_extmark_id or not _G.current_suggestion then
    -- No active suggestion to accept
    return
  end

  local bufnr = 0
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local current_line = cursor_pos[1]

  -- Get the first line of the suggestion
  local first_suggestion_line = _G.current_suggestion[1]

  -- Insert the first line of the suggestion into the buffer
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, current_line - 1, current_line - 1, false, { first_suggestion_line })

  -- Move the cursor to the next line, after the inserted text
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line, #first_suggestion_line })

  -- Clear existing extmark and suggestion
  vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, _G.current_extmark_id)
  _G.current_extmark_id = nil
  _G.current_suggestion = nil


  -- Trigger a new suggestion *after* processing the current line
  vim.schedule(function()
    _G.suggest()  -- Call suggest directly
  end)
end

-- ... (rest of the code)
```

The key change is using `vim.schedule()` and calling `_G.suggest()` directly inside the scheduled function. This ensures the new suggestion is triggered *after* the current line has been processed and the buffer updated, preventing issues with the cursor position and text before/after cursor detection.  We also removed the redundant `suggest` call that was causing the "recursive lua call" error.


## 2.  Getting Content of Unvisited Buffers

The issue is that Neovim lazily loads buffers.  When you open multiple files with a glob, they are not fully read into memory until you visit them.  `vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines()` will return an empty table for unvisited buffers.

Here's the corrected `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` with `M.get_buffer_content`:

```lua
-- ... other functions

-- get the content of a given buffer, even if not visited
function M.get_buffer_content(buf)
  -- Force loading of the buffer
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf, 0, -1, false, {}) -- This forces the buffer to load

  local content = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(buf, 0, -1, false)
  local name = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(buf)
  M.log(name .. " get_buffer_content: " .. vim.inspect(content))
  return table.concat(content, "\n")
end

-- ... rest of the module
```

The crucial addition is `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf, 0, -1, false, {})`. This seemingly redundant operation forces Neovim to load the buffer content into memory.  After this call, `vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines()` will return the actual buffer content.  I've also improved the logging message for clarity.


With these changes, your plugin should be able to accept the first suggestion line, trigger a new suggestion, and correctly access the content of all opened buffers.  Let me know if you have any other questions.
