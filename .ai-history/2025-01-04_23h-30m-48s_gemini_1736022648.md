# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

With the existing code, after I type `<M-PageDown>`:
- The cursor is placed at the end of the line.
- The letter "a" appended to the end of the line.
- I see "Entered generate_sentence()" in the log file.
- The suggestion doens't appear in the buffer: this is the problem to solve.
- There is no error message.

Analyze the code and tell me how to get the suggestion to appear in the buffer.
If some debug is needed, tell me where to put the log instructions.

The issue lies within how you're handling the cursor position and inserting the virtual text.  You're adding the virtual text at the current cursor position *before* moving the cursor to the end of the line with `vim.api.nvim_feedkeys("a", 'n', false)`. This "a" insertion offsets everything, and the virtual text ends up in the wrong spot, often hidden.  Also, the `feedkeys("a")` is unnecessary.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

-- Define the highlight group for the suggestion text
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "InlineSuggestion", { fg = "#808080", bg = "NONE" })

-- Global variables to keep track of extmarks
_G.current_extmarks = nil

-- Function to clear the current suggestion
local function clear_suggestion()
  if _G.current_extmarks then
    for _, extmark in pairs(_G.current_extmarks) do
      vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, extmark.ns, extmark.id)
    end
    _G.current_extmarks = nil
  end
end

local function show_suggestion()
  clear_suggestion()
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  -- Move cursor to the end of the line *first*
  vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes("<Esc>A", true, false, true), 'n', false)  
  local current_cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')
  _G.current_extmarks = {}

  -- Set the extmark *after* moving the cursor
  local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, current_cursor_pos[1] - 1, current_cursor_pos[2], {
    virt_text = { { suggestion, "InlineSuggestion" } },
    virt_text_pos = 'overlay',
  })
  table.insert(_G.current_extmarks, { ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id })

  -- Remove the unnecessary 'a' insertion
  -- vim.api.nvim_feedkeys("a", 'n', false)  
end

-- Map <M-PageDown> to show_suggestion in insert mode
vim.keymap.set('i', '<M-PageDown>', show_suggestion, { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when typing
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when leaving insert mode
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})
```

Key Changes:

1. **Cursor Movement First:** The `vim.api.nvim_feedkeys("<Esc>A", 'n', false)` is now called *before* the `nvim_buf_set_extmark` function. This ensures the extmark is placed at the correct end-of-line position.

2. **Removed Extra 'a':** The `vim.api.nvim_feedkeys("a", 'n', false)` line has been removed as it's no longer needed and was causing the offset issue.


With these changes, the suggestion should appear correctly, pushing the subsequent lines down as intended.  The rest of your logic for clearing the suggestion on typing or leaving insert mode remains correct.
