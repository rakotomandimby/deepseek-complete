# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement everything in one step, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).
- Get the content of the current buffer know how to split it into 2 parts: 
    - the first part is the text from the begining of the buffer to the cursor position
    - the second part is the text from the cursor position to the end of the buffer
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.
If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion disappears.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears, again and again.

That is the desired behavior.

## Step 3: Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).

Now the current code allows to transform the inline suggestion into regular text with the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence.

## Step 4: Get the text before and after the cursor then log it into the logs

When in INSERT mode and issue the `<M-PageDown>` key sequence:
- the cursor goes the end of the current line
- the content from the beginning of the line to the cursor position is stored in a variable
- the content from the cursor position to the end of the buffer is stored in a variable
- the logs confirms the 2 variables has the correct content

That is the desired behavior. Let's continue to implement the remaining steps without breaking the current features.

## Step 5: Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.

According to the DeepSeek API documentation, the API expects a POST request with the following body:

```
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data-raw '{
  "messages": [
    {"content": "You are a helpful assistant", "role": "system"},
    {"content": "Hi","role": "user"}
  ],
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "frequency_penalty": 0,
  "max_tokens": 2048,
  "presence_penalty": 0,
  "response_format": {
    "type": "text"
  },
  "stop": null,
  "stream": false,
  "stream_options": null,
  "temperature": 1,
  "top_p": 1,
  "tools": null,
  "tool_choice": "none",
  "logprobs": false,
  "top_logprobs": null
}'
```

I use "plenary.nvim" to make the HTTP requests.
For the moment, I log the DeepSeek API response into the logs.

The problem with the code in `./plugin/init.lua` is that `vim.fn.json_encode` which is used to encode the request body cannot be called inside a callback.

But I want the `choices[].text` to be displayed in the logs.

Propose me the modifications to `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve what I want.

```lua
-- lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
-- No changes needed in this file for this step

local M = {}

-- Function to log a message into /tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log
function M.log(message)
  local log_file = io.open("/tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log", "a")
  -- check if log_file is nil
  if log_file == nil then
    print("Error opening log file")
    return
  end
  log_file:write(message .. "\n")
  log_file:close()

function M.generate_sentence()
  M.log("Entered generate_sentence()")
  local sentences = { -- ... (sentences remain unchanged)
  }
  return sentences[math.random(#sentences)]
end

return M
```

```lua
-- plugin/init.lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

local function handle_deepseek_response(response)
  if response.status == 200 then
    -- Log the API response
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("DeepSeek API response:\n" .. response.body)
    -- json decode the response body
    local body = vim.fn.json_decode(response.body)

    -- response.body is a Lua table of choices
    -- Loop on the choices and display them
    for _, choice in pairs(body.choices) do
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(choice.text)
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("===========================")
    end
  else
    -- Log the error
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("DeepSeek API request failed with status: " .. tostring(response.status))
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Response body:\n" .. response.body)
  end
end


_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  -- ... (Existing code for cursor positioning, getting text before/after cursor remains unchanged)

  local deepseek_api_token = os.getenv("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY")
  local deepseek_request_body = {
    -- ... (deepseek_request_body construction remains unchanged)
  }


  -- Move the POST request outside the callback
  curl.post('https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions', {
    body = vim.fn.json_encode(deepseek_request_body),
    headers = {
      ["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
      ["Accept"] = "application/json",
      ["Authorization"] = "Bearer " .. deepseek_api_token
    },
    callback = handle_deepseek_response -- Use the defined function here
  })

  -- ... (Rest of the function for generating and displaying random sentences remains unchanged)
end


_G.accept_suggestion = function()
  -- ... (This function remains unchanged)
end

-- ... (Autocommands and keymappings remain unchanged)
```

The key change is moving the `curl.post` call and the JSON decoding/logging logic *outside* the callback and into a separate function `handle_deepseek_response`.  This function is then passed as the `callback` argument to `curl.post`. This solves the issue of `vim.fn.json_encode` not working inside the callback because it's now called in the main thread.  The `handle_deepseek_response` function will be executed when the HTTP request completes, and it can then safely access and process the response body.


Now, when you trigger the suggestion with `<M-PageDown>`, the DeepSeek API will be queried, and the response (including the `choices[].text`) will be logged to `/tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log`.  The random sentence suggestion functionality should still work as before.
