# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
the plugin suggests with a random sentence picked from the list of sentences. 
The suggestion text appears in grey.

If I leave the INSERT mode, the suggestion is removed.

After the suggestion is displayed, if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears the same way as it does when I leave the INSERT mode.

That is good.

But if I re-continue to type then re-trigger the completion, the suggestion is not removed anymore. The "erase-if-I-type" only works once.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion disappear if I continue to type over it any number of times.

To ensure that the inline suggestion disappears every time you type over it, you need to modify the `TextChangedI` autocmd to handle the case where the suggestion is displayed multiple times. The current implementation only removes the suggestion once, and then it does not clear it on subsequent typing.

### Suggested Changes

1. **Modify the `TextChangedI` Autocmd**: You need to ensure that the suggestion is cleared every time a change is detected in insert mode, regardless of how many times the suggestion has been displayed.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `plugin/init.lua` file to achieve this:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

-- Define a highlight group for the inline suggestion
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "InlineSuggestion", { fg = "#808080", bg = "NONE" }) -- Grey color

_G.completion_handler = nil
_G.current_extmark = nil -- Store the extmark ID

local function clear_suggestion()
    if _G.current_extmark then
        vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, _G.current_extmark.ns, _G.current_extmark.id)
        _G.current_extmark = nil
    end
end

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertEnter", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        _G.completion_handler = function()
            local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
            local current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[2]
            local current_word = vim.fn.expand("<cword>")

            local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()

            clear_suggestion() -- Clear any existing suggestion

            local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace("rktmb-deepseek-complete-ns")
            local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1] - 1, current_col, {
                virt_text = {{suggestion, "InlineSuggestion"}}, -- Use the defined highlight group
                virt_text_pos = "overlay",
                hl_mode = "combine" -- Important for proper highlighting
            })

            _G.current_extmark = {ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id}
        end

        vim.keymap.set("i", "<M-PageDown>", function()
            vim.defer_fn(_G.completion_handler, 0)
            return ""
        end, { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })

        -- Autocmd to clear the suggestion on further typing
        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
            buffer = 0,
            callback = function()
                clear_suggestion() -- Clear the suggestion on any typing
            end
        })
    end
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        vim.keymap.del("i", "<M-PageDown>")
        _G.completion_handler = nil
        clear_suggestion()
    end
})
```

### Key Changes Made:

- **Removed the single-use restriction**: The `TextChangedI` autocmd now simply calls `clear_suggestion()` every time a change is detected in insert mode. This ensures that the suggestion is cleared regardless of how many times you type after it has been displayed.

### Summary

With these changes, the inline suggestion will be removed every time you type, allowing for a more fluid experience when using the plugin. You can now trigger the suggestion multiple times without encountering the issue of the suggestion not disappearing.
