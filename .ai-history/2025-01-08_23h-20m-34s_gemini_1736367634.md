## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types `<M-ESC>` key, a suggestion is triggered and the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
But if the user continues typing, the suggestion must be cleared.
If the types `<M-ESC>` key again, the suggestion must be triggered and the new suggestion will be displayed when it arrives.
This must be repeatable any number of times.

Note that inserting suggestions is a text modification, so be careful to not delete the suggestion when inserting it.

With the current code, after the suggestion is displayed and I type something, I get the following error:

```
Error detected while processing InsertCharPre Autocommands for "*":
Error executing lua callback: ....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:29: E565: Not allowed to change text or change window
```

Tell me the modifications I need to make the suggestion clearing .

The error you're getting, "E565: Not allowed to change text or change window", arises because you're attempting to modify the buffer (by clearing the suggestion and removing inserted lines) within an `InsertCharPre` autocommand.  This autocommand fires *before* the character is actually inserted, making buffer modifications unsafe.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

local api_call_in_progress = false
local last_api_call_time = 0

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

-- ... (rest of your config and functions remain the same)

local function clear_suggestion()
  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Remove the inserted lines if any
  if _G.num_lines_inserted and _G.num_lines_inserted > 0 then
    local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
    local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + 1, row + 1 + _G.num_lines_inserted, false, {}) -- remove the inserted lines
    _G.num_lines_inserted = 0 -- Reset after removing lines
  end
end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end
})

-- Use InsertEnter instead of InsertCharPre
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertEnter", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end
})


-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- ... (rest of your keymappings)
```

Key changes:

1. **`InsertEnter` Autocommand:**  We've replaced `InsertCharPre` with `InsertEnter`.  This autocommand is triggered *after* entering insert mode, allowing you to safely modify the buffer.  This ensures the suggestion is cleared when you start typing or when you switch to insert mode.  Since the suggestion is already cleared when leaving insert mode, using `InsertLeave` might be redundant, but it's harmless to keep it for consistency.



With this change, the suggestion should clear correctly when you type any character after triggering it with `<M-ESC>`, avoiding the "E565" error.  The `InsertLeave` autocommand ensures the suggestion is also cleared when you leave insert mode.
