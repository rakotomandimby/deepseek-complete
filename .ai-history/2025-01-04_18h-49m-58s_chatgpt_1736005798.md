# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode, if I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
then the plugin should suggest to complete the current word with a random sentence 
picked from the list of sentences. The suggestion text should appear in grey.

The problem is when I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`, the completion actually written in the buffer and doesn't behave as an inline suggestion.

I want it to be an inline suggestion, not a typed text.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make it an inline suggestion.

To make the completion behave as an inline suggestion rather than inserting the text directly into the buffer, you need to modify the way the completion is triggered and how the completion items are presented. 

### Changes Needed

1. **Use `vim.fn.complete()` correctly**: The `vim.fn.complete()` function is used to provide completion suggestions, but it should be called in a way that it doesn't insert the text directly into the buffer. Instead, it should show the suggestions in a completion menu.

2. **Set the completion context**: You need to ensure that the completion context is set correctly so that the completion suggestions appear as inline suggestions.

### Updated Code

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `plugin/init.lua` file to achieve the desired behavior:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

_G.completion_handler = nil

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertEnter", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        -- Set the completion handler
        _G.completion_handler = function()
            local current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[2]
            local current_word = vim.fn.expand("<cword>")

            local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()

            -- Use the complete function to show suggestions
            vim.fn.complete(current_col + 1, {
                { word = suggestion, kind = "random sentence", menu = "[random]", icase = 1, abbr = current_word }
            })
        end

        vim.keymap.set("i", "<M-PageDown>", function()
            vim.defer_fn(_G.completion_handler, 0)
            return ""  -- Return an empty string to prevent inserting anything
        end, { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })
    end
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        vim.keymap.del("i", "<M-PageDown>")
        _G.completion_handler = nil -- Clear the handler when leaving insert mode
    end
})
```

### Key Changes Explained

1. **Completion Context**: The `vim.fn.complete(current_col + 1, ...)` is used to ensure that the completion suggestions appear at the correct position in the buffer. The `current_col + 1` is used to suggest the completion right after the current word.

2. **Return Empty String**: In the key mapping for `<M-PageDown>`, returning an empty string (`return ""`) prevents any text from being inserted into the buffer when the key is pressed. This allows the completion menu to show up without inserting the suggestion directly.

3. **Inline Suggestion Appearance**: The completion menu will now show the random sentence as an inline suggestion, allowing the user to select it without it being typed directly into the buffer.

### Conclusion

With these changes, when you press `<M-PageDown>` in INSERT mode, the plugin will suggest a random sentence as an inline suggestion without inserting it directly into the buffer. You can further enhance the plugin by implementing the DeepSeek API in future steps.
