# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.

It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.

The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).

The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

With the existing code:
- The cursor is placed at the end of the line.
- I see "Generated suggestion: ..." in the log file.
- The suggestion doens't appear in the buffer.
- There is no error message.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the suggestion appear in the buffer.
If some debug is needed, tell me where to put the log instructions.

To make the inline suggestion appear in the buffer as intended, we need to ensure that the extmarks are being set correctly and that the cursor position is managed properly. Let's analyze the existing code and identify the necessary changes.

### Issues Identified

1. **Cursor Positioning**: The cursor is moved to the end of the line, but the extmarks are being set based on the current cursor position without accounting for the new line that will be created by the suggestion.

2. **Extmark Creation**: The extmarks are created using the current cursor position, but they should be created on the next line after the current line to avoid overlapping.

3. **Clearing Suggestions**: The suggestion should be cleared when typing, which is already implemented, but we need to ensure that the suggestion is displayed correctly before it gets cleared.

### Suggested Changes

1. **Adjust the Extmark Creation**: When creating extmarks for the suggestion, we need to set them on the line below the current line.

2. **Add Debug Logging**: We can add some debug logging to check the cursor position and the extmark IDs being created.

### Updated Code

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `show_suggestion` function in `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local function show_suggestion()
  clear_suggestion()

  -- Get the current buffer and cursor position *BEFORE* moving the cursor
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local current_cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the current line
  vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes("<Esc>A", true, false, true), 'n', true)

  -- Generate a random sentence
  local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Generated suggestion: " .. suggestion)

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, "\n")

  -- Create a namespace for our extmarks
  local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

  -- Set extmarks for each line of the suggestion
  _G.current_extmarks = {}

  -- Set extmarks starting from the next line after the current cursor position
  for i, line in ipairs(lines) do
    local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, current_cursor_pos[1] + i, 0, {
      virt_text = { { line, "InlineSuggestion" } },
      virt_text_pos = 'overlay',
    })
    table.insert(_G.current_extmarks, { ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id })
  end

  -- Log the extmark IDs for debugging
  for _, extmark in ipairs(_G.current_extmarks) do
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Created extmark ID: " .. extmark.id .. " at line: " .. (current_cursor_pos[1] + i))
  end
end
```

### Key Changes Explained

- **Cursor Position**: The extmarks are now set starting from `current_cursor_pos[1] + i`, which places the suggestions on the lines below the current line.
  
- **Debug Logging**: Added logging to track the extmark IDs created, which can help in debugging if the suggestions do not appear as expected.

### Next Steps

1. **Test the Changes**: After making these changes, test the plugin in Neovim to see if the suggestions appear correctly.

2. **Check the Log File**: Review the log file at `/tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log` to see the generated suggestions and extmark IDs for any anomalies.

3. **Iterate**: If the suggestions still do not appear, further debugging may be needed, such as checking the buffer state or ensuring that the extmarks are being set correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to get the inline suggestions to appear as intended.
