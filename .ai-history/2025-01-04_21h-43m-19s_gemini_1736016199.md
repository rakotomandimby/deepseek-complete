# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.

It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.

The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).

The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

Take the existing code and continue it in order to get what I want.

```lua

local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "InlineSuggestion", { fg = "#808080", bg = "NONE" })

    end

  local line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  local row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]

  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, "\n", { plain = true })

  _G.current_extmarks = {}
  local ns = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
  for i, line_content in ipairs(lines) do
    local extmark = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns, row + i - 1, #line, {
      virt_text = { { line_content, "InlineSuggestion" } },
      virt_text_pos = "eol",
    })
    table.insert(_G.current_extmarks, { ns = ns, id = extmark })
  end

  _G.completion_handler = vim.api.nvim_buf_attach(0, false, {
    on_lines = function(_, _, _, _, _)
      clear_suggestion()
      _G.completion_handler = nil
    end,
  })
end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertEnter", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.keymap.set("i", "<M-PageDown>", suggest, { buffer = true })
  end
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.keymap.del("i", "<M-PageDown>")
    _G.completion_handler = nil
    clear_suggestion()
  end
})
```

Key changes:

* **`suggest()` function:** This function now handles creating the inline suggestions. It gets the current line and row, generates the random sentence, splits it into lines, and then uses `nvim_buf_set_extmark` to add the virtual text at the end of the line, pushing subsequent lines down.  The `virt_text_pos = "eol"` is crucial for this behavior.  It also stores the extmarks so they can be cleared later.
* **`clear_suggestion()` function:** This function clears any existing suggestions by iterating through the stored extmarks and deleting them.
* **`_G.completion_handler`:** This global variable stores the buffer attachment, which is used to detect changes in the buffer and clear the suggestions when the user types.
* **Autocommands:**  The code now uses `InsertEnter` to set up the keymap for `<M-PageDown>` and `InsertLeave` to clear the keymap and any existing suggestions.  This ensures the keymap is only active in insert mode and suggestions are cleaned up properly.
* **Namespace:** A namespace `rktmb-deepseek-complete` is created to avoid conflicts with other plugins that might use extmarks.


This improved version addresses the multi-line suggestion, proper placement, and clearing on typing.  It also uses a more robust approach for managing the suggestions and avoids potential conflicts.
