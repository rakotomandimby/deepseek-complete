# Get the content of the line the cursor is on

In `./plugin/init.lua`, there is a local variable `line_the_cursor_is_on` that is supposed to store the content of the line the cursor is on.
The problem is that the variable is empty.

Analyze the code and tell me what I need to change to get the content of the line the cursor is on in the variable `line_the_cursor_is_on`.

You're right, the `line_the_cursor_is_on` variable isn't getting the correct content.  The issue lies in how you're extracting the line content. You're using `string.sub` on the current line *after* the cursor position, effectively getting the rest of the line but not the part before the cursor.  Since you want the *entire* line, you should just use the entire line from `lines[current_row]`.

Here's the corrected section of `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

-- ... (rest of your code)

_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  -- ... (other code)

  -- Get buffer content before and after cursor
  local current_buffer = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local lines = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(current_buffer, 0, -1, false)
  local text_before_cursor = table.concat(lines, "\n", 1, current_row - 1) .. "\n" .. string.sub(lines[current_row], 1, current_col)
  local text_after_cursor = string.sub(lines[current_row], current_col + 1) .. "\n" .. table.concat(lines, "\n", current_row + 1)

  -- FIX: Get the entire current line
  local line_the_cursor_is_on = lines[current_row]

  -- ... (rest of your code)
end

-- ... (rest of your code)
```

By changing  `local line_the_cursor_is_on = string.sub(lines[current_row], current_col + 1)` to `local line_the_cursor_is_on = lines[current_row]`, you now capture the complete line content where the cursor is positioned.  This will provide the correct context to your DeepSeek prompt.
