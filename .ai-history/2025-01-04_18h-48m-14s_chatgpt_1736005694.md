# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be a code completion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Suggest a completion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode, if I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
then the plugin should suggest to complete the current word with a random sentence 
picked from the list of sentences. The suggestion text should appear in grey.

The problem is when I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`, the completion actually written in the buffer and doesn't behave as an inline suggestion.

I want it to be an inline suggestion, not a typed text.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make it an inline suggestion.

To make the completion behave as an inline suggestion rather than being directly inserted into the buffer, you need to modify the way the completion is triggered and how the completion items are presented to Neovim.

### Changes Needed

1. **Use the `vim.fn.complete()` function correctly**: The `vim.fn.complete()` function is used to provide completion suggestions, but it should be called in a way that it doesn't insert the text directly into the buffer. Instead, it should provide a list of suggestions based on the current context.

2. **Ensure the completion is shown as a suggestion**: You need to ensure that the completion is shown as a suggestion rather than being inserted into the buffer. This can be done by using the `complete()` function correctly and ensuring that the completion handler is set up properly.

### Updated Code

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `plugin/init.lua` file to achieve the desired behavior:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

_G.completion_handler = nil

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertEnter", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        -- Set the completion handler
        _G.completion_handler = function()
            local current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[2] -- Get the current column
            local current_word = vim.fn.expand("<cword>") -- Get the current word

            local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()

            -- Provide completion suggestions
            vim.fn.complete(current_col, {
                { word = suggestion, kind = "random sentence", menu = "[random]", icase = 1, abbr = current_word }
            })
        end

        vim.keymap.set("i", "<M-PageDown>", function()
            vim.defer_fn(_G.completion_handler, 0) -- Call the completion handler
            return "" -- Return an empty string to prevent inserting text
        end, { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })
    end
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        vim.keymap.del("i", "<M-PageDown>")
        _G.completion_handler = nil -- Clear the handler when leaving insert mode
    end
})
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Return an empty string**: In the key mapping for `<M-PageDown>`, returning an empty string (`return ""`) prevents any text from being inserted into the buffer when the key sequence is pressed. This allows the completion suggestion to be shown without affecting the current text.

- **Completion Context**: The completion context is maintained by using `vim.fn.complete()` with the current column and the generated suggestion. This ensures that the suggestion appears as an inline suggestion.

### Conclusion

With these changes, when you press `<M-PageDown>` in INSERT mode, the plugin will suggest a random sentence as a completion without inserting it directly into the buffer. The suggestion will appear in the completion menu, allowing you to select it if desired.
