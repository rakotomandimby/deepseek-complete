# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

Tell me what to put in `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

```lua

local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

local function get_cursor_position()
  return vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
end

  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row, col })

  local row, _ = get_cursor_position()

end


local function suggest()
    local row, col = get_cursor_position()
    local current_line = get_current_line()
    local end_col = #current_line + 1

    set_cursor_position(row, end_col)

    local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()

    vim.fn.complete(0, {
        { word = suggestion, kind = "ï…› Suggestion", icase = 1, abbr = suggestion, info = suggestion, empty = 1 },
    })

end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertEnter", {
    callback = function()
        vim.keymap.set("i", "<M-PageDown>", suggest, { noremap = true, silent = true, buffer = true })
    end
})


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"TextChangedI", "TextChangedP"}, {
    callback = function()
        if vim.fn.pumvisible() == 1 then
            vim.fn.complete(0, {}) -- clear suggestions
        end
    end,
    group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("completion_clear", { clear = true }),
})


```

```lua
-- lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
-- Initialize a module
local M = {}

-- Function to log a message into /tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log
function M.log(message)
  local log_file = io.open("/tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log", "a")
  -- check if log_file is nil
  if log_file == nil then
    print("Error opening log file")
    return
  end

  log_file:close()
end

  M.log("Entered generate_sentence()")
  local sentences = {
    "The quick brown \nfox jumps over the lazy \ndog in the park.\nIt enjoys the sunny day.",
    "The five boxing \nwizards jump quickly,\nwhile the lazy dog\nsleeps under the tree.",
    "Pack my box with \nfive dozen liquor jugs.\nThe jugs are heavy,\nbut the party will be fun.",
    "How vexingly quick \ndaft zebras jump.\nThey leap over the fence,\nchasing after the butterflies.",
    "In a world of chaos,\nwhere dreams collide,\nwe find solace in the\nwhispers of the night.",
    "The stars twinkle brightly,\nilluminating the dark sky.\nEach one tells a story,\nwaiting to be discovered.",
    "What do you get if \nyou multiply six by nine?\nA riddle wrapped in mystery,\nwaiting for an answer.",
    "If six is nine, \nwhat do you get?\nA paradox of numbers,\nwhere logic takes a break.",
    "I'm not a number, \nI'm a free man.\nI wander through life,\nseeking adventures untold.",
    "Hey, I'm a free man. \nWhat do you get if you multiply six by nine?\nA question that lingers,\nlike a shadow in the dark.",
  }
  return sentences[math.random(#sentences)]
end

return M

Key improvements:

* **Cursor Positioning:** Ensures the cursor is at the end of the line before suggesting.
* **Clearing Suggestions:**  Clears existing suggestions when the user types, allowing for repeated suggestions.  This uses autocommands for `TextChangedI` and `TextChangedP` and a dedicated augroup for cleaner management.
* **Multi-line Suggestions:**  The completion item is configured to handle multi-line suggestions correctly.  The `info` field is used to display the full suggestion in the preview window.
* **Insert Mode Mapping:** The mapping for `<M-PageDown>` is now only set when in insert mode, avoiding potential conflicts.



This setup should provide the behavior you're looking for.  If the grey color isn't working, it might be due to your Neovim theme. You can customize the appearance of the completion menu further using `vim.api.nvim_set_hl` if needed.  Let me know if you have any other questions.
