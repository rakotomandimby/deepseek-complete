# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

I wrote `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

But when I type `<M-PageDown>`, the inline suggestion appears as just one line with a `^@` in the place of the newline character.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion display on multiple lines and push down the lines below.

The issue lies in how you're handling newlines within the virtual text.  Virtual text doesn't interpret `\n` as a newline; it treats it as a literal character.  You need to create separate chunks for each line of the suggestion, including the newline characters themselves as separate chunks.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  local current_row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()

  -- Move to the end of the current line *before* generating the sentence
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {current_row, #current_line + 1})

  local sentence = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local lines = vim.split(sentence, "\n", true)

  -- Construct virtual text chunks with proper newlines
  local chunks = {}
  for i, line in ipairs(lines) do
    table.insert(chunks, {line, "Comment"})  -- No explicit \n here
    if i < #lines then
      table.insert(chunks, {"\n", "Comment"}) -- Actual newline character as a separate chunk
    end
  end


  local current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[2]

  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_row - 1, current_col, {
    virt_text = chunks,
    virt_text_pos = 'overlay'
  })

  -- Clear on TextChangedI
  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", {clear = true})
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
    group = augroup_id,
    buffer = 0,
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id) -- Important: Delete the autocmd group
    end
  })
end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
  end
})

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageDown>", "<Cmd>lua suggest_random_sentence()<CR>", {noremap = true, silent = true})
```

Key Changes:

1. **Separate Newline Chunks:** The code now adds a separate virtual text chunk `{"\n", "Comment"}` for each newline. This tells Neovim to actually insert a newline in the virtual text display.

2. **Removed `\n` from Line Chunks:**  The `\n` is removed from the line chunks themselves, as it's now handled by the separate newline chunks.

3. **Highlighting:** The `Comment` highlight group is used for consistent styling.  You can change this to any highlight group you prefer.

With these changes, the multi-line suggestions should render correctly, pushing subsequent lines down as expected.  The suggestions will also disappear as you type further and reappear when you press `<M-PageDown>` again.
