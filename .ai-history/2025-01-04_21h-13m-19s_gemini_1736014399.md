You want me to modify the `generate_sentence` function within `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` to return sentences spanning 4 or 5 lines instead of the current 1 or 2 lines.  Here's the modified `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` file:

```lua
-- Initialize a module
local M = {}

-- Function to log a message into /tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log
function M.log(message)
    local log_file = io.open("/tmp/rktmb-deepseek-complete.log", "a")
    log_file:write(message .. "\n")
    log_file:close()
end

-- Function to generate a random sentence
function M.generate_sentence()
  M.log("Entered generate_sentence()")
  local sentences = {
    "The quick brown fox\njumps over the lazy dog.\nThis is line three.\nAnd this is line four.",
    "The five boxing wizards\njump quickly.\nAnother line here.\nOne more line.\nAnd a fifth line.",
    "Pack my box with five\ndozen liquor jugs.\nThis makes three lines.\nFour lines now.\nFive lines total.",
    "How vexingly quick daft\nzebras jump.\nLine three is here.\nThis is the fourth line.",
    "Pack my box with five dozen\nliquor jugs and a box of\nchocolates.  This is three.\nFour lines now.\nAnd finally five.",
    "How vexingly quick daft zebras\njump over the lazy brown fox.\nThis is the third line.\nFourth line here.",
    "What do you get if you multiply\nsix by nine?  This is line\nnumber three.  Fourth line here.\nAnd a fifth line for good measure.",
    "If six is nine, what do you\nget? This is line two.\nThird line here.\nFourth line for you.",
    "If six is nine, what do you get\nif you multiply six by nine?\nThis is line three.\nFourth line here.",
    "I'm not a number, I'm a free\nman. This is the second line.\nThird line is present.\nFourth line here.",
    "I'm not a number, I'm a free man.\nWhat do you get if you multiply\nsix by nine?  Third line here.\nFourth line now.",
    "Hey, I'm a free man. What do you\nget if you multiply six by nine?\nThis is the third line.\nFourth line here.",
    "Hey, I'm a free man. What do you\nget if you multiply six by nine?\nThis is the third line.\nFourth line here.\nFifth line for you.",
  }
  return sentences[math.random(#sentences)]
end

return M
```

The `plugin/init.lua` file remains unchanged.  The key change is within the `sentences` table in `generate_sentence`.  Each sentence now spans 4 or 5 lines, separated by `\n`.  This will cause the completion suggestions to display across multiple lines as you requested.  Remember to reload your Neovim configuration after making these changes.
