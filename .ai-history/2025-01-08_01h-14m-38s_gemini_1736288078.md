# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

The suggestion is triggered each time the user type the space key.
When the user types fast, the suggestion is triggered only if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types, the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
But as far as the user types, the suggestion must be cleared.
If a new suggestion comes, the old suggestion must be cleared.
If the user continues typing, the suggestion must be cleared and the new suggestion will be displayed when it arrives.
This behaviour must be repeatable any time the user types.

The current code implements those behaviors, but it has one problem: When clearing a multi-line suggestion, there are many blank lines left behind.

To avoid that, I want to store the number of lines that has been pushed down by the suggestion.
Then, when clearing the suggestion, I want to remove the lines that have been pushed down.

Tell me the modifications I need to make the suggestion clearing to revert the lines that have been pushed down.

To address the issue of leftover blank lines when clearing multi-line suggestions, you need to track how many lines were inserted and then remove them when clearing.  Here's the modified `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` and `plugin/init.lua` files:

```lua
-- lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
-- Initialize a module
local M = {}

-- ... (Existing code remains unchanged) ...

function M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)
  -- ... (Existing code up to clearing extmarks) ...

  -- Store the number of lines inserted
  local num_lines_inserted = 0
  if #lines > 1 then
    num_lines_inserted = #lines - 1
  end

    -- ... (Existing code for setting extmarks) ...

  -- Store the number of inserted lines globally
  _G.num_lines_inserted = num_lines_inserted
end


-- ... (Rest of the existing code remains unchanged) ...

return M
```

```lua
-- plugin/init.lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

-- ... (Existing code remains unchanged) ...

local function clear_suggestion()
  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(current_buf, _G.ns_id, 0, -1)

  -- Remove the inserted lines if any
  if _G.num_lines_inserted and _G.num_lines_inserted > 0 then
    local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
    local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(current_buf, row + 1, row + 1 + _G.num_lines_inserted -1, false, {}) -- remove the inserted lines
    _G.num_lines_inserted = 0 -- Reset after removing lines
  end
end

local function process_deepseek_response(response)
  vim.schedule(function()  -- Use vim.schedule to run this in the main thread
    clear_suggestion() -- Clear previous suggestion
    local response_body = vim.fn.json_decode(response.body)
    -- ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
  end)
end


_G.suggest = function()
    clear_suggestion() -- Clear previous suggestion
    -- ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end
})

-- ... (Rest of the existing code remains unchanged) ...
```

Key changes:

* **`_G.num_lines_inserted`**:  This global variable now stores the number of lines inserted by the suggestion.  It's updated in `M.set_suggestion_extmark`.
* **`clear_suggestion()` function**: This function now handles both clearing the extmarks *and* removing the inserted blank lines using `nvim_buf_set_lines` with an empty table `{}`. It also resets `_G.num_lines_inserted`.
* **Call `clear_suggestion()`**: The `clear_suggestion()` function is called at the beginning of `_G.suggest` and `process_deepseek_response` to ensure any existing suggestion is cleared before a new one is displayed.
* **`TextChangedI` autocmd**: This autocmd triggers `clear_suggestion()` whenever the text changes in insert mode, ensuring the suggestion is cleared as the user types. This replaces the `InsertLeave` autocmd.


This revised code should correctly clear multi-line suggestions and remove the extra blank lines, providing a smoother user experience.  Remember to set your `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable.
