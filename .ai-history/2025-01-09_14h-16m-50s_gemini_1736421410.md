## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

When a suggestion is displayed, I want the user to be able to accept one word with the `<M-Right>` key.

As far as there is a suggestion, if the user presses `<M-Right>`, 
the first word of the suggestion is accepted and transformed into text at the same position.

Note: Gihub Copilot and Supermaven Neovim plugins do that.

The suggestion might be on the same line as the cursor or on a different line: we have to handle that case.

With the current implementation, when the user accepts a word, the word is inserted at the same position as the cursor but without space.

Tell me the steps to implement the word-by-word acceptance but with a space between the words.

The issue is that you're not adding a space after inserting the accepted word.  Also, your current logic for handling newlines at the beginning of the suggestion could be simplified.  Here's the improved `accept_suggestion_word` function and a breakdown of the changes:

```lua
function M.accept_suggestion_word()
    if _G.current_suggestion then
        -- Find the position of the next space or newline, or end of string
        local next_space = _G.current_suggestion:find("[%%%%s\n]") or #_G.current_suggestion + 1
        local word = _G.current_suggestion:sub(1, next_space - 1)

        -- Count leading newlines
        local num_newlines = 0
        while _G.current_suggestion:sub(1, 1) == "\n" do
            num_newlines = num_newlines + 1
            _G.current_suggestion = _G.current_suggestion:sub(2) -- Remove newline
        end

        local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
        local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
        local row = position[1] - 1
        local col = position[2]

        -- Adjust cursor position for leading newlines
        row = row + num_newlines
        if num_newlines > 0 then
            col = 0 -- Start at beginning of line after newlines
        end
        vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + 1, col })


        -- Insert the accepted word and a space into the buffer
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(current_buf, row, col, row, col, { word .. " " })

        -- Update cursor position after insertion
        col = col + #word + 1 -- +1 for the space
        vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { row + 1, col })

        -- Remove the accepted word, space, and any leading whitespace/newlines from the suggestion
        _G.current_suggestion = _G.current_suggestion:sub(next_space)
        _G.current_suggestion = _G.current_suggestion:gsub("^%%%%s*", "")  -- Remove any leading whitespace

        -- Update the displayed suggestion
        M.clear_suggestion()
        if _G.current_suggestion and #_G.current_suggestion > 0 then
            M.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
        else
            _G.current_suggestion = nil
        end
    end
end
```

Here's a breakdown of the key changes:

1. **Simplified Newline Handling:** The code for handling leading newlines is now a simple `while` loop.  This is more efficient and easier to read than the previous regex-based approach.  It also directly removes the newlines from `_G.current_suggestion`.

2. **Added Space After Word:** The most important change is adding `" .. " "` to insert a space after the accepted word.

3. **Cursor Position Update:** The cursor position update now also accounts for the added space (`col = col + #word + 1`).

4. **Clearer Suggestion Removal:** The code for removing the accepted word from the suggestion is now more concise and directly uses the `next_space` index.  This makes it clearer what portion of the string is being removed.


With these changes, accepting words should work correctly, inserting each word with a space after it and handling newlines appropriately.  Remember to update your `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` file with this new function.
