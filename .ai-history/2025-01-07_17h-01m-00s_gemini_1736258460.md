# Implment the "finish the sentence" feature

The "finish the sentence" feature is a feature that uses the DeepSeek API to complete the current sentence.

- The user types letters in the current buffer.
- The suggestion is triggered by the user typing letters, spaces, or punctuation marks.
- The suggestion is appended to the current line the cursor is on.
- The user can accept the suggestion by pressing the `<M-Right>` key.
- If the user continues typing letters, the must be updated by querying the DeepSeek API.

There will be a different function to build the messages table for the "finish the sentence" feature.
We will use a different prompt but we will keep giving context.

Propose the modifications to the code to implement the "finish the sentence" feature.

Key changes:

- **`build_messages_table_finish_sentence`**:  New function with a prompt tailored for sentence completion.
- **`suggest_finish_sentence`**: New function to handle the API call and processing for sentence completion.  It reuses much of the existing `suggest` function's logic.
- **`make_deepseek_request`**:  New function to encapsulate the API call, making it reusable.
- **`TextChangedI` autocommand**: Triggers `suggest_finish_sentence` whenever text is changed in insert mode.
- **`<M-Right>` keymap**: Now calls `accept_the_whole_suggestion`.


This revised code addresses the prompt by creating a distinct "finish the sentence" feature triggered by typing, using a dedicated messages table builder and prompt, and allowing acceptance with `<M-Right>`.  It also improves code structure with the `make_deepseek_request` function.  Remember to set your `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable.
