# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

I wrote `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

But when I type `<M-PageDown>`, the inline suggestion appears before the cursor is moved to the end of the line and is not multiline: it is just one line with a `^@` in the place of the newline character.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the cursor move to the end of the line and then display the inline suggestion on multiple lines and push down the lines below.

The issue lies in the order of operations and how you're handling the newline characters within the virtual text.  You're also not correctly moving the cursor to the end of the line. Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  -- 1. Move cursor to the end of the line *FIRST*
  local current_row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_row, #current_line +1 })


  local sentence = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local lines = vim.split(sentence, "\n", true)

  -- Log the lines (for debugging)
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Lines:")
  for _, line in ipairs(lines) do
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(line)
  end
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("")

  -- Use virtual text for multi-line suggestions.  Crucially, use \n as the actual newline
  local chunks = {}
  for i, line in ipairs(lines) do
    table.insert(chunks, { line, "Comment" })  -- Use "Comment" highlight group for grey
    if i < #lines then
      table.insert(chunks, { "\n", "Comment" }) -- Preserve newlines with correct highlighting
    end
  end

  local current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[2] -- Get updated column after moving cursor

  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_row - 1, current_col, { virt_text = chunks, virt_text_pos = 'overlay' })

  -- Clear the suggestion on TextChangedI (unchanged)
  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", { clear = true })
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
    group = augroup_id,
    buffer = 0,
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id)
    end,
  })
end


vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
  end,
})

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageDown>", "<Cmd>lua suggest_random_sentence()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

```

Key Changes:

1. **Cursor Movement First:** The code now moves the cursor to the end of the current line *before* calculating the current column and setting the virtual text.  This is essential because the virtual text position depends on the cursor position.  We use `#current_line + 1` to ensure we're at the very end, even if the line is empty.

2. **Consistent Newline Handling:** The `\n` characters are now inserted into the `chunks` table with the "Comment" highlight group.  This ensures they are styled consistently with the rest of the suggestion.  Previously, using "Normal" for the newline caused styling issues and prevented the multiline behavior from working correctly.  The newline characters themselves are now directly embedded as `\n` within the virtual text chunks.

3. **Updated Column Retrieval:** The `current_col` is now retrieved *after* moving the cursor to the end of the line. This ensures the virtual text is placed at the correct position.


With these changes, the multiline suggestions should appear correctly, pushing the subsequent lines down as expected, and the grey highlighting should be consistent.  The suggestions will also disappear as you type further, as per the existing autocommand.
