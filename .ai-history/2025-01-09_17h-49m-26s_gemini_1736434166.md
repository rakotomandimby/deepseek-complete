## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

Note: I want to implement the same accept word as Gihub Copilot and Supermaven Neovim plugins. 

When a suggestion is displayed as extmark, when the user issues the `<M-Right>` key,
the first word of the extmark is turned into text at the same position and the cursor is moved forward.

That is the behavior I want.

However, when the extmark is multi-line, after issuing the `<M-Right>` key:
- all the text of the current line is cleared.
- the cursor is moved to begining of the current line.
- the extmark is not cleared and I can accept extmark words one by one

I want to keep the working features working as before, and handle correctly the multi-line extmarks.

I want that if the extmark is multi-line, the cursor moves like I want above.

Give me the code of the `M.accept_suggestion_word()` function that implements this behavior.

```lua
function M.accept_suggestion_word()
  if not _G.current_suggestion or _G.current_suggestion == "" then
    return
  end

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
  local col = position[2]

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(_G.current_suggestion, '\n', true)

  -- Get the first word of the current line's suggestion
  local current_line_suggestion = lines[1]
  local first_word, rest_of_line = current_line_suggestion:match("^(%%%%S+)(.*)")

  if not first_word then
    -- No word found on the current line, move to the next line if available
    if #lines > 1 then
      table.remove(lines, 1) -- Remove the current line from the suggestion
      _G.current_suggestion = table.concat(lines, '\n')
      M.clear_suggestion()
      if _G.current_suggestion ~= "" then
        M.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
      end
      vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {row + 2, 1}) -- Move cursor to the next line
    end
    return
  end

  -- Insert the first word at the current cursor position
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(current_buf, row, col, row, col, {first_word .. " "})

  -- Update the current suggestion
  lines[1] = rest_of_line:match("^%%%%s*(.*)") or ""
  _G.current_suggestion = table.concat(lines, '\n')

  -- Clear the current extmark and set a new one with the updated suggestion
  M.clear_suggestion()
  if _G.current_suggestion ~= "" then
    M.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
  end

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the inserted word
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {row + 1, col + #first_word + 1})
end
```


Key changes and explanations:

1. **Splitting the suggestion into lines:** The suggestion is now split into lines to handle multi-line suggestions correctly.
2. **Handling empty lines:**  If the current line of the suggestion is empty or contains only whitespace, it's removed, and the cursor moves to the next line.
3. **Updating the suggestion:** The `_G.current_suggestion` is updated by replacing the current line with the remaining part of the line after the accepted word.  This ensures that the next call to `accept_suggestion_word` works correctly.
4. **Cursor Movement:** The cursor is now moved *after* the extmark is updated, preventing the cursor from jumping to the beginning of the line.  It's also moved to the correct position in multi-line suggestions.
5. **Clearing the suggestion:** The suggestion is cleared before setting the new extmark to avoid overlapping extmarks. This also handles cases where the accepted word is the last word in the suggestion.
6. **Space after word:** A space is added after the inserted word for better formatting.


This improved version should address the issues you were experiencing with multi-line suggestions and provide a smoother experience.  Remember to test it thoroughly.
