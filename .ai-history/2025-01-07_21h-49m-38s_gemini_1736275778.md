# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now I want to insert the returned by the DeepSeek API as an extmark.

The extmark will start after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.

We will use the `nvim_buf_set_extmark()` function to do that.

The DeepSeek API response is a multiline string, so there might be a processing step to split it into lines.

Tell me what modifications I need to make to the code in order to achieve that.

      }
    })
  else
    -- Create new extmark
    _G.current_extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(current_buf, _G.ns_id, row, col, {
      end_row = row + #vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true) -1,
      end_col = string.len(vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)[#vim.split(suggestion, '\n', true)]),
      virt_text = {{suggestion, "Comment"}},
      virt_text_pos = "overlay"
    })
  end
end

-- ... (Rest of the code) ...
```

```lua
-- plugin/init.lua
-- ... (Existing code) ...

local function process_deepseek_response(response)
  vim.schedule(function()
    local response_body = vim.fn.json_decode(response.body)
    if response_body.choices and #response_body.choices > 0 then
      local choice = response_body.choices[1]
      local suggestion = choice.message.content
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("\n\nSuggestion from DeepSeek API:")
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.log(suggestion)

      -- Set or update the extmark with the new suggestion
      rktmb_deepseek_complete.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)

      _G.current_suggestion = suggestion -- Store the current suggestion
    end
  end)
end

-- ... (Rest of the code) ...
```

Key changes:

* **`rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`**:  A new function `M.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)` is added. This function handles creating or updating the extmark based on the provided `suggestion` string.  It calculates the end row and column for multi-line suggestions and uses `virt_text` to display the suggestion as an overlay.  It also stores the extmark ID in `_G.current_extmark_id` so it can be updated later.
* **`plugin/init.lua`**: Inside `process_deepseek_response`, the `rktmb_deepseek_complete.set_suggestion_extmark(suggestion)` function is called after receiving a successful response from the DeepSeek API. This ensures the extmark is updated with the latest suggestion.  The suggestion is also stored in `_G.current_suggestion`.

With these changes, the plugin should now display inline suggestions from the DeepSeek API as extmarks, updating them dynamically after each API call.  The suggestions will appear as comments overlaid after the cursor.  Remember to adjust the styling ("Comment" highlight group) as needed.
