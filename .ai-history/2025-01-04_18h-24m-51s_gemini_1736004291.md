# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be a code completion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Suggest a completion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode, if I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
then the plugin should suggest to complete the current word with a random sentence picked from the list of sentences. The suggestion text must appear in grey.

The problem is that I get the following error when I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>` in insert mode:

```
E5108: Error executing lua: Vim:E565: Not allowed to change text or change window
stack traceback:
        [C]: in function 'complete'
        ....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:14: 
in function <....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:7>
```

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to fix the problem.

The error `E5108: Error executing lua: Vim:E565: Not allowed to change text or change window` arises because you're attempting to use the `vim.fn.complete()` function, which modifies the buffer, within an `InsertEnter` autocommand.  During `InsertEnter`, Neovim locks the buffer to prevent modifications from functions triggered by the autocommand itself. This is a safety measure to avoid unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua` and an explanation of the changes:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

-- Use a global variable to store the completion handler
_G.completion_handler = nil

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertEnter", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        -- Set the completion handler
        _G.completion_handler = function()
            local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
            local current_col = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[2]
            local current_word = vim.fn.expand("<cword>")

            local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()

            vim.fn.complete(current_col, {
                { word = suggestion, kind = "random sentence", menu = "[random]", icase = 1, abbr = current_word }
            })
        end


        vim.keymap.set("i", "<M-PageDown>", function()
            -- Call the completion handler with a timer to defer execution
            vim.defer_fn(_G.completion_handler, 0)
            return "" -- Return empty string to avoid inserting characters.
        end, { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })
    end
})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
    pattern = "*",
    callback = function()
        vim.keymap.del("i", "<M-PageDown>")
        _G.completion_handler = nil -- Clear the handler when leaving insert mode
    end
})
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Deferred Execution with `vim.defer_fn()`:** The core fix is using `vim.defer_fn(_G.completion_handler, 0)`. This schedules the `_G.completion_handler` function (which contains the completion logic) to be executed *after* the `InsertEnter` autocommand has finished and the buffer lock is released.  The `0` as the second argument ensures it runs as soon as possible.

2. **Global Variable `_G.completion_handler`:**  This stores the completion function so it can be accessed and called by the deferred function.  This is necessary because the function needs to be defined *outside* the deferred call.

3. **Return Empty String:** The mapping for `<M-PageDown>` now returns an empty string (`return ""`). This prevents the `<M-PageDown>` keypress from inserting any unwanted characters into the buffer.

4. **Clearing the Handler:** The `_G.completion_handler` is set to `nil` within the `InsertLeave` autocommand. This is good practice to clean up and avoid potential issues.



With these changes, pressing `<M-PageDown>` in insert mode will correctly trigger the completion and suggest a random sentence without the `E5108` error. The suggestion will appear gray because the default styling for completion menus in Neovim uses gray for the completion text.


This approach is cleaner and more reliable than using `feedkeys()` or other workarounds.  It leverages Neovim's built-in mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations and buffer modifications.
