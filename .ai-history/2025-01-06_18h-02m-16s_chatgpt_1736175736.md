# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement everything in one step, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).
- Get the content of the current buffer know how to split it into 2 parts: 
    - the first part is the text from the begining of the buffer to the cursor position
    - the second part is the text from the cursor position to the end of the buffer
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.
If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion disappears.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears, again and again.

That is the desired behavior.

## Step 3: Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).

Now the current code allows to transform the inline suggestion into regular text with the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence.

## Step 4: Get the text before and after the cursor then log it into the logs

Logging is achieved with the following code:

```
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb-deepseek-complete.log("The text to log")
```

When in INSERT mode and issue the `<M-PageDown>` key sequence, I want to add the feature to:
- put the cursor at the end of the line
- get the content from the beginning of the line to the cursor position and store it in a variable
- get the content from the cursor position to the end of the buffer and store it in a variable
- log the 2 variables into the logs

The features that already work must continue to work.

Tell me the modifications I need to make to the code in order to achieve what I want.

To achieve the desired functionality, we need to modify the existing code in `plugin/init.lua` to include the logging of the text before and after the cursor when the `<M-PageDown>` key sequence is triggered. Below are the modifications you need to make:

### Step 1: Modify `plugin/init.lua`

We will update the `suggest_random_sentence` function to log the text before and after the cursor position. Hereâ€™s the modified content of `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

_G.current_extmark_id = nil
_G.current_suggestion = nil

_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  local current_row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]

  -- Ensure the cursor is at the end of the current line
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {current_row, #current_line})

  -- Get the content before and after the cursor
  local buffer_content = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(0, 0, -1, false)
  local text_before_cursor = table.concat(buffer_content, "\n"):sub(1, vim.fn.col('.'))
  local text_after_cursor = table.concat(buffer_content, "\n"):sub(vim.fn.col('.'))

  -- Log the text before and after the cursor
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Text before cursor: " .. text_before_cursor)
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Text after cursor: " .. text_after_cursor)

  -- Generate the random sentence
  local sentence = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local lines = vim.split(sentence, "\n", true)

  -- Store the suggestion globally
  _G.current_suggestion = lines

  -- Construct virt_lines with proper formatting
  local virt_lines = {}
  for _, line in ipairs(lines) do
    table.insert(virt_lines, { { line, "Comment" } }) -- Use "Comment" highlight group for grey text
  end

  -- Set the extmark with virt_lines
  local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_row - 1, 0, {
    virt_lines = virt_lines,
    virt_lines_above = false, -- Place the virtual lines below the current line
    hl_mode = 'combine'       -- Combine with existing text highlighting
  })

  -- Store the extmark ID globally
  _G.current_extmark_id = extmark_id

  -- Clear the suggestion on text change or insert leave
  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", { clear = true })
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "TextChangedI", "InsertLeave" }, {
    group = augroup_id,
    buffer = 0,
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, ns_id, extmark_id)
      _G.current_extmark_id = nil
      _G.current_suggestion = nil
      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id)
    end
  })
end

_G.accept_suggestion = function()
  if not _G.current_extmark_id or not _G.current_suggestion then
    -- No active suggestion to accept
    return
  end

  local bufnr = 0
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local current_line = cursor_pos[1]

  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, current_line, current_line, false, _G.current_suggestion)
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line + #_G.current_suggestion, 0 })
  vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, _G.current_extmark_id)

  _G.current_extmark_id = nil
  _G.current_suggestion = nil
end

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
  end
})

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageDown>", "<Cmd>lua suggest_random_sentence()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageUp>", "<Cmd>lua accept_suggestion()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Get Buffer Content**: We retrieve the entire content of the buffer using `vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(0, 0, -1, false)`.

2. **Extract Text Before and After Cursor**: We use `vim.fn.col('.')` to get the current cursor position and split the buffer content into two parts:
   - `text_before_cursor`: The text from the beginning of the buffer to the cursor position.
   - `text_after_cursor`: The text from the cursor position to the end of the buffer.

3. **Log the Text**: We log both `text_before_cursor` and `text_after_cursor` using the existing logging function.

### Conclusion

With these modifications, your plugin will now log the text before and after the cursor when the `<M-PageDown>` key sequence is triggered, while still maintaining the existing functionality of generating and accepting random sentence suggestions. You can proceed to implement the next steps involving the DeepSeek API once this functionality is confirmed to be working.
