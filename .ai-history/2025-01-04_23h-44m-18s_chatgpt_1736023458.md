# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

Tell me what to put in `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

To implement the desired functionality in your Neovim plugin, you will need to modify the `plugin/init.lua` file to handle the key mapping, insert the random sentence as a suggestion, and manage the display of that suggestion. Below is the complete content for `plugin/init.lua` that achieves this:

```lua
-- Import the module
local deepseek = require('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

-- Function to display the suggestion
local function display_suggestion(sentence)
  -- Get the current buffer and cursor position
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the current line
  local line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  local new_line = line .. sentence
  vim.api.nvim_set_current_line(new_line)

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the new line
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { cursor_pos[1], #new_line })

  -- Highlight the suggestion text
  vim.cmd("highlight SuggestionText guifg=#808080")
  vim.api.nvim_buf_add_highlight(bufnr, -1, "SuggestionText", cursor_pos[1] - 1, #line, -1)

  -- Set an autocommand to clear the suggestion when typing
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertCharPre", {
    buffer = bufnr,
    callback = function()
      -- Clear the suggestion if any character is typed
      vim.api.nvim_set_current_line(line) -- Reset to original line
      vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(bufnr, -1, 0, -1) -- Clear highlights
      vim.api.nvim_del_autocmd(vim.fn.getcmdline()) -- Remove the autocommand
    end,
  })
end

-- Key mapping for <M-PageDown>
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<M-PageDown>', 'v:lua.trigger_suggestion()', { noremap = true, expr = true, silent = true })

-- Function to trigger the suggestion
function _G.trigger_suggestion()
  local sentence = deepseek.generate_sentence()
  display_suggestion(sentence)
  return '' -- Return empty string to avoid inserting anything else
end
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Import the Module**: The `deepseek` module is imported to access the `generate_sentence` function.

2. **Display Suggestion Function**: 
   - This function takes a sentence as an argument.
   - It retrieves the current buffer and cursor position.
   - It appends the random sentence to the current line and moves the cursor to the end of the new line.
   - It highlights the suggestion text in grey using a custom highlight group.
   - An autocommand is set to clear the suggestion when any character is typed.

3. **Key Mapping**: 
   - The `<M-PageDown>` key sequence is mapped to trigger the suggestion function in insert mode.

4. **Trigger Suggestion Function**: 
   - This function generates a random sentence and calls the `display_suggestion` function to show it.

### Final Steps:
- Make sure to reload your Neovim configuration or restart Neovim to apply the changes.
- Test the functionality by entering insert mode and pressing `<M-PageDown>` to see the random sentence suggestion.

This implementation should meet your requirements for step 2 of your project. Let me know if you need further assistance!
