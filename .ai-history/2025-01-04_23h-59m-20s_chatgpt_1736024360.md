# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.
The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

I wrote `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve the desired functionality.

But when I type `<M-PageDown>`, the error message appears:

```
E5108: Error executing lua [string ":lua"]:1: module 'plugin.init' not found:
        no field package.preload['plugin.init']
cache_loader: module plugin.init not found
cache_loader_lib: module plugin.init not found
        no file './plugin/init.lua'
stack traceback:
        [C]: in function 'require'
        [string ":lua"]:1: in main chunk
```

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to fix the issue.

The error you're encountering is due to how Neovim handles module loading in Lua and the structure of your plugin files. Let's analyze the issue and I'll guide you through the necessary steps to fix it.

---

## **Understanding the Error**

The error message you received is:

```
E5108: Error executing lua [string ":lua"]:1: module 'plugin.init' not found:
        no field package.preload['plugin.init']
cache_loader: module plugin.init not found
cache_loader_lib: module plugin.init not found
        no file './plugin/init.lua'
```

This indicates that when Neovim tries to execute `require('plugin.init')`, it's unable to locate the `plugin/init.lua` file within its `package.path`. The `package.path` is a list of directories where Lua looks for modules when using `require`.

---

## **Analyzing Your Plugin Structure**

Your current project structure is:

```
.
├── lua
│   └── rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
└── plugin
    └── init.lua
```

- **`lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`**: Contains the `generate_sentence()` function.
- **`plugin/init.lua`**: Contains the code that uses `require('rktmb-deepseek-complete')` and maps the `<M-PageDown>` key.

---

## **Understanding Neovim's Plugin Directories**

- **`plugin/` Directory**: This is used for Vimscript and Lua files that should be automatically sourced/executed when Neovim starts. Lua files here are executed at startup but are **not** available as modules that can be required.
- **`lua/` Directory**: This is where you place Lua modules that can be required using `require('<module_name>')`.

---

## **Why the Error Occurs**

- **Cannot Require Files from `plugin/` Directory**: Lua modules inside the `plugin/` directory are not in the `package.path` by default and cannot be required like regular Lua modules.
- **Incorrect Module Path**: When you try to `require('plugin.init')`, Lua cannot find `plugin/init.lua` in any of the directories listed in `package.path`.

---

## **How to Fix the Issue**

### **Option 1: Move `init.lua` into the `lua/` Directory**

1. **Change the Project Structure**:

   ```
   .
   └── lua
       ├── rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
       └── plugin
           └── init.lua
   ```

   - Move `plugin/init.lua` to `lua/plugin/init.lua`.
   - Now both your Lua modules are inside the `lua/` directory.

2. **Adjust the `require` Statements**:

   In your `lua/plugin/init.lua`, update the require statement to match the new path:

   ```lua
   local deepseek_complete = require('rktmb-deepseek-complete')
   ```

   (This stays the same since `rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` is still directly under `lua/`.)

3. **Update the Key Mapping**:

   Because the module is now `lua/plugin/init.lua`, you can require it using `plugin.init`. The key mapping in `lua/plugin/init.lua` should be:

   ```lua
   vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<M-PageDown>', '<Cmd>lua require("plugin.init").show_suggestion()<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
   ```

4. **Ensure Neovim Can Find the Module**:

   Neovim's Lua `package.path` by default includes the `lua/` directory, so `require('plugin.init')` will now find `lua/plugin/init.lua`.

### **Option 2: Adjust the `package.path`**

If you prefer to keep your current directory structure, you can modify the `package.path` so that Lua knows where to find your `plugin/init.lua`.

However, this is less standard and can lead to confusion, so I recommend reorganizing your files as in Option 1.

### **Option 3: Use a Plugin Manager or Runtime Path**

Alternatively, you can place your Lua code in a proper plugin directory structure or use a plugin manager like **Packer**, which handles runtime paths for you. But since we're focusing on fixing the current issue, reorganizing the files is the quickest solution.

---

## **Step-by-Step Fix**

Let's go through the steps to implement Option 1 in detail.

### **1. Create the `lua/plugin/` Directory**

In your project root, create a `plugin` directory inside `lua`:

```bash
mkdir lua/plugin
```

### **2. Move `init.lua` to `lua/plugin/`**

Move your `init.lua` file:

```bash
mv plugin/init.lua lua/plugin/init.lua
```

Your project structure now looks like:

```
.
├── lua
│   ├── plugin
│   │   └── init.lua
│   └── rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua
```

### **3. Adjust the `require` Statements**

In `lua/plugin/init.lua`, ensure that the require statement for `rktmb-deepseek-complete` is correct:

```lua
local deepseek_complete = require('rktmb-deepseek-complete')
```

Since `rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` is in `lua/`, it can be required directly as `'rktmb-deepseek-complete'`.

### **4. Update the Key Mapping**

The key mapping in `lua/plugin/init.lua` should remain as:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<M-PageDown>', '<Cmd>lua require("plugin.init").show_suggestion()<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### **5. Remove the Empty `plugin/` Directory**

Since the `plugin/` directory is no longer needed (unless you have other initialization code), you can delete it:

```bash
rmdir plugin
```

### **6. Test the Plugin**

Restart Neovim and test the `<M-PageDown>` key mapping in insert mode.

---

## **Explanation**

By moving `init.lua` into the `lua/` directory, you're making it accessible as a Lua module that can be required using `require('plugin.init')`. Neovim automatically includes the `lua/` directory in its `package.path`, so Lua knows to look there when resolving modules.

---

## **Additional Recommendations**

### **Organize Your Plugin Under a Namespace**

It's common practice to use a unique namespace for your plugin to prevent conflicts with other plugins. For example, you can create a directory with your plugin name inside `lua/`:

```
.
├── lua
│   └── rktmb_deepseek_complete
│       ├── init.lua     -- Your main plugin code
│       └── generator.lua  -- The generate_sentence function
```

Then, adjust your code accordingly:

- **Move `rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` to `lua/rktmb_deepseek_complete/generator.lua`**.
- **Update your `init.lua` to require the generator**:

  ```lua
  local deepseek_complete = require('rktmb_deepseek_complete.generator')
  ```

- **Update the key mapping to reflect the new structure**:

  ```lua
  vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<M-PageDown>', '<Cmd>lua require("rktmb_deepseek_complete").show_suggestion()<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
  ```

This makes your plugin more maintainable and avoids polluting the global namespace.

---

## **Conclusion**

The error occurs because Lua cannot find `plugin.init` in its module search paths. By reorganizing your files and placing `init.lua` inside the `lua/` directory, you make it accessible to Lua's `require` function.

**Next Steps**:

- Move `init.lua` to `lua/plugin/init.lua` as outlined.
- Adjust any `require` statements if necessary.
- Restart Neovim and test the key mapping.
- Consider organizing your plugin under a unique namespace for better maintainability.
