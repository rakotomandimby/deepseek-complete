# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
I want the plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then suggest with a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.

It is important to place the cursor at the end of the line before suggesting because suggestion is based on an existing text.

The suggestion text must appears in grey (#808080).

The suggestion text must push down the lines below it and not overlap with the text below.

If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion must disappear.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion must disappear, again and again.

With the existing code:
- I see "Generated suggestion: ..." in the log file.
- The suggestion doens't appear in the buffer.
- There is no error message.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the suggestion appear in the buffer.
If some debug is needed, tell me where to put the log instructions.

The issue lies within how you're handling the cursor position and calculating the lines for virtual text.  You're using `vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)` which gets the cursor position *before* you've moved the cursor to the end of the line.  Therefore, the virtual text is being placed at the original cursor position, likely overwritten by the subsequent move to the end of the line.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua`:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Entered init.lua")

-- Define the highlight group for the suggestion text
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "InlineSuggestion", { fg = "#808080", bg = "NONE" })

-- Global variables to keep track of extmarks
_G.current_extmarks = nil

-- Function to clear the current suggestion
local function clear_suggestion()
  if _G.current_extmarks then
    for _, extmark in pairs(_G.current_extmarks) do
      vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, extmark.ns, extmark.id)
    end
    _G.current_extmarks = nil
  end
end

-- Function to show the suggestion when triggered
local function show_suggestion()
  clear_suggestion()

  -- Get the current buffer and cursor position *BEFORE* moving the cursor
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local initial_cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)

  -- Move the cursor to the end of the line
  vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes("<Esc><End>a", true, false, true), 'n', true)

  -- Generate a random sentence
  local suggestion = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  rktmb_deepseek_complete.log("Generated suggestion: " .. suggestion)

  -- Split the suggestion into lines
  local lines = vim.split(suggestion, "\n")


  -- Get the cursor position *AFTER* moving to the end of the line.  Crucially, use initial_cursor_pos[1] for the line!
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local cursor_line = initial_cursor_pos[1] -1 -- zero-indexed
  local cursor_col = cursor_pos[2]


  -- Create a namespace for our extmarks
  local ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')

  -- Set extmarks for each line of the suggestion
  _G.current_extmarks = {}

  for i, line in ipairs(lines) do
    local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, cursor_line + i -1, cursor_col, {  -- cursor_line is already zero-indexed
      virt_text = { { line, "InlineSuggestion" } },
      virt_text_pos = 'overlay',
    })
    table.insert(_G.current_extmarks, { ns = ns_id, id = extmark_id })
  end
end

-- Map <M-PageDown> to show_suggestion in insert mode
vim.keymap.set('i', '<M-PageDown>', show_suggestion, { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when typing
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("TextChangedI", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})

-- Auto command to clear the suggestion when leaving insert mode
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    clear_suggestion()
  end,
})
```

Key Changes:

1. **Get Cursor Position Before Moving:** The initial cursor position is now captured *before* the cursor is moved to the end of the line.
2. **Use Correct Line Number:** The `cursor_line` is now derived from `initial_cursor_pos[1]`, ensuring the virtual text is placed on the correct line.  We also subtract 1 because `initial_cursor_pos[1]` is 1-indexed and `nvim_buf_set_extmark` expects a 0-indexed line number.
3. **Simplified `cursor_line` calculation:** Removed an unnecessary -1 since we already accounted for 0-indexing earlier.


With these changes, the suggestions should appear correctly below the current line, pushing subsequent lines down, and disappear when you type or leave insert mode.
