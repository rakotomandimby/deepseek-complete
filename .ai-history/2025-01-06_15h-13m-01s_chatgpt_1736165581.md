# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.
If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion disappears.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears, again and again.

That is the desired behavior.

## Step 3: Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.

I want to transform the inline suggestion into regular text because I like that suggested sentence.
I want that if I issue the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence, the suggestion is transformed into regular text.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion to be transformed into regular text with the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence.




# This is gpt-4o-mini answer (1k in, 1k out)

To implement the functionality that allows transforming the inline suggestion into regular text when the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence is issued, you will need to make some modifications to your existing code in `plugin/init.lua`. Below are the steps and the updated code to achieve this.

### Steps to Implement the Transformation

1. **Track the Current Suggestion**: You need to keep track of the current suggestion so that it can be transformed into regular text when `<M-PageUp>` is pressed.

2. **Modify the Key Mapping**: Add a new key mapping for `<M-PageUp>` that will replace the virtual lines with the actual text of the suggestion.

3. **Update the Callback Function**: In the callback function for `<M-PageUp>`, you will need to replace the virtual lines with the actual text in the buffer.

### Updated Code

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your `plugin/init.lua` file:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")

_G.ns_id = vim.api.nvim_create_namespace('rktmb-deepseek-complete')
_G.current_suggestion = nil -- Track the current suggestion

_G.suggest_random_sentence = function()
  local current_row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]

  -- Ensure the cursor is at the end of the current line
  local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, {current_row, #current_line})

  -- Generate the random sentence
  local sentence = rktmb_deepseek_complete.generate_sentence()
  local lines = vim.split(sentence, "\n", true)

  -- Construct virt_lines with proper formatting
  local virt_lines = {}
  for _, line in ipairs(lines) do
    table.insert(virt_lines, { { line, "Comment" } }) -- Use "Comment" highlight group for grey text
  end

  -- Set the extmark with virt_lines
  local extmark_id = vim.api.nvim_buf_set_extmark(0, ns_id, current_row - 1, 0, {
    virt_lines = virt_lines,
    virt_lines_above = false, -- Place the virtual lines below the current line
    hl_mode = 'combine' -- Combine with existing text highlighting
  })

  -- Store the current suggestion for later use
  _G.current_suggestion = sentence

  -- Clear the suggestion on text change or insert leave
  local augroup_id = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("RktmbDeepseekCompleteSuggestions", { clear = true })
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "TextChangedI", "InsertLeave" }, {
    group = augroup_id,
    buffer = 0,
    callback = function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(0, ns_id, extmark_id)
      vim.api.nvim_del_augroup_by_id(augroup_id)
      _G.current_suggestion = nil -- Clear the current suggestion
    end
  })
end

-- New function to accept the current suggestion
_G.accept_current_suggestion = function()
  if _G.current_suggestion then
    local current_row = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)[1]
    local current_line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
    local new_line = current_line .. _G.current_suggestion

    -- Replace the current line with the new line
    vim.api.nvim_set_current_line(new_line)

    -- Clear the suggestion
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
    _G.current_suggestion = nil -- Clear the current suggestion
  end
end

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("InsertLeave", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    vim.api.nvim_buf_clear_namespace(0, ns_id, 0, -1)
  end
})

vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageDown>", "<Cmd>lua suggest_random_sentence()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", "<M-PageUp>", "<Cmd>lua accept_current_suggestion()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Tracking Current Suggestion**: A global variable `_G.current_suggestion` is introduced to store the current suggestion generated by the `suggest_random_sentence` function.

2. **Accepting the Suggestion**: A new function `accept_current_suggestion` is created. This function checks if there is a current suggestion and appends it to the current line in the buffer. It also clears the virtual lines and resets the current suggestion.

3. **Key Mapping for Accepting Suggestion**: The key mapping for `<M-PageUp>` is added to call the `accept_current_suggestion` function.

With these changes, you will be able to transform the inline suggestion into regular text by pressing `<M-PageUp>`.
