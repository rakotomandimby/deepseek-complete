# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

When the user types fast, the suggestion may only be triggered if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.
That is the behavior I want.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types `<M-ESC>` key, a suggestion is triggered and the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
If the user continues typing, the suggestion is cleared.
If the types `<M-ESC>` key again, the suggestion is triggered and the new suggestion is displayed when it arrives.
This is repeatable any number of times.

This is the behavior I want.

## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

When a suggestion is displayed, I want the user to be able to accept it word by word with the `<M-Right>` key.
So, as far as there is a suggestion, if the user presses `<M-Right>`, 
the first word of the suggestion is accepted and transformed into text at the same position.

Tell me the modifications I need to make in order to achieve that.




# This is o1-preview answer (3k in, 3k out)

To achieve **Step 7**, where you want the user to accept the suggestion word by word using the `<M-Right>` key, you'll need to make some modifications to your existing code. Below are the steps and code changes required to implement this functionality.

---

### **1. Add a Function to Accept One Word of the Suggestion**

In your `plugin/init.lua` file, define a new function `accept_one_suggestion_word()` that does the following:

- Checks if there is a current suggestion.
- Extracts the next word from the suggestion.
- Inserts the word at the cursor position.
- Moves the cursor forward.
- Updates the suggestion to remove the accepted word.
- Updates the extmark to reflect the remaining suggestion.

**Here's how you can implement it:**

```lua
-- Function to accept one word from the suggestion
local function accept_one_suggestion_word()
  if not _G.current_suggestion or _G.current_suggestion == '' then
    return
  end

  local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local position = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local row = position[1] - 1 -- Adjust to 0-based indexing
  local col = position[2]

  -- Get the next word from the current suggestion
  local s = _G.current_suggestion
  local next_word = s:match("^(%%S+)%%s*)")
  if not next_word then
    -- No more words to accept
    clear_suggestion()
    _G.current_suggestion = nil
    return
  end

  -- Insert the next word at the cursor position
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(current_buf, row, col, row, col, { next_word })

  -- Move the cursor forward by the length of the inserted word
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { position[1], position[2] + #next_word })

  -- Update the current suggestion by removing the accepted word and any leading whitespace
  _G.current_suggestion = s:sub(#next_word + 1):gsub("^%%s+", "")

  -- Update the extmarks to show the remaining suggestion
  clear_suggestion()
  if _G.current_suggestion and _G.current_suggestion ~= '' then
    rktmb_deepseek_complete.set_suggestion_extmark(_G.current_suggestion)
  else
    _G.current_suggestion = nil
  end
end
```

**Explanation:**

- **Check for Existing Suggestion:** The function first checks if there's a current suggestion; if not, it does nothing.
- **Extract Next Word:** Uses Lua's pattern matching to find the next word (`%%S+`) and any following whitespace.
- **Insert Word:** Inserts the word at the current cursor position using `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text`.
- **Move Cursor:** Updates the cursor position to be after the inserted word.
- **Update Suggestion:** Removes the accepted word from `_G.current_suggestion` and trims leading whitespace.
- **Update Extmark:** Clears the current suggestion display and sets a new extmark for the remaining suggestion.

---

### **2. Update the Key Mapping for Accepting a Word**

In the same `plugin/init.lua` file, you need to map the `<M-Right>` key to the `accept_one_suggestion_word()` function in insert mode.

First, ensure that your default options include the `accept_word_keymap` setting. Add this to your `default_opts`:

```lua
local default_opts = {
  deepseek_api_key = os.getenv("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"),
  suggest_lines_keymap = "<M-ESC>",
  accept_all_keymap = "<M-PageDown>",
  accept_line_keymap = "<M-Down>",
  accept_word_keymap = "<M-Right>",  -- Add this line
  debounce_time = 1000,
}
```

---

### **3. Uncomment and Add the Key Mapping**

In your current code, the key mappings for accepting suggestions are commented out. Uncomment and update the mapping for accepting a word:

```lua
-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
-- Uncomment the following line to enable accepting a word
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_word_keymap, "<Cmd>lua accept_one_suggestion_word()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

---

### **4. Ensure Correct Scope and Dependencies**

Make sure that the `accept_one_suggestion_word()` function is within the correct scope in your `plugin/init.lua` file and that it has access to the following:

- `_G.current_suggestion`
- `clear_suggestion()` function
- `rktmb_deepseek_complete.set_suggestion_extmark()` function

Your updated `plugin/init.lua` should now look something like this:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

-- ... [existing code] ...

-- Add the accept_one_suggestion_word function here
local function accept_one_suggestion_word()
  -- [Function code as above]
end

-- ... [existing code] ...

-- Key mappings
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.suggest_lines_keymap, "<Cmd>lua suggest()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("i", user_opts.accept_word_keymap, "<Cmd>lua accept_one_suggestion_word()<CR>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- ... [rest of your code] ...
```

---

### **5. Test the Implementation**

After making these changes, test the functionality:

- Enter insert mode and trigger a suggestion using `<M-ESC>`.
- When the suggestion appears, press `<M-Right>` to accept the next word.
- The accepted word should be inserted into the buffer at the cursor position.
- The suggestion display should update to reflect the remaining words.
- You can continue pressing `<M-Right>` to accept more words one at a time.
- If there are no more words to accept, the suggestion should clear automatically.

---

### **Optional: Handle Edge Cases and Enhancements**

- **Accepting the Entire Suggestion:** You may also want to implement functions to accept the entire suggestion or accept one line at a time. You can follow a similar pattern to create `accept_the_whole_suggestion()` and `accept_one_suggestion_line()` functions.
- **Auto-Clearing Suggestion:** Ensure that if the suggestion becomes empty after accepting words, it clears properly.
- **Visual Feedback:** You might consider providing visual feedback when the suggestion is fully accepted or no longer available.

---

### **Summary**

By adding the `accept_one_suggestion_word()` function and updating your key mappings, you've implemented the desired functionality to accept suggestions word by word using the `<M-Right>` key.

**Note:** Remember to handle any potential errors and test thoroughly to ensure a smooth user experience. If you encounter any issues, double-check the function scopes and ensure all dependencies are correctly referenced.
