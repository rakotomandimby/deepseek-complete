# Accept the first line of the suggestion and triger again

There is a keymap and a function to accept the first line of a suggestion: `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line()`.

It accepts the first line of the suggestion with the keymap `<M-Down>`.
When I accept the first line, the remaining suggestions lines are discarded and another suggestion is triggered based on that accepted line.

The problem is the accepted line goes one line above the current line of the cursor. I do not have that problem with the `_G.accept_the_whole_suggestion()` function.

Analyze the code, compare the functions and tell me the modifications I have to make to get the accepted line below the line of the cursor.

The issue lies in how you're setting the lines and subsequently the cursor position in `accept_one_suggestion_line`.  You're using `current_line - 1` as the starting point for setting the lines, effectively inserting the suggestion *before* the current line.  You then move the cursor to `current_line`, which is now the line *after* the inserted suggestion.

Here's the corrected `plugin/init.lua` file:

```lua
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
local curl = require('plenary.curl')

-- ... (rest of the code is the same)

_G.accept_one_suggestion_line = function()
  if not _G.current_extmark_id or not _G.current_suggestion then
    -- No active suggestion to accept
    return
  end

  local bufnr = 0
  local cursor_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
  local current_line = cursor_pos[1]

  -- Get the first line of the suggestion
  local first_suggestion_line = _G.current_suggestion[1]

  -- Insert the first line of the suggestion into the buffer *after* the current line
  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, current_line, current_line, false, { first_suggestion_line })

  -- Move the cursor to the next line, after the inserted text
  vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line + 1, #first_suggestion_line }) -- + 1 here is crucial

  -- Clear existing extmark and suggestion
  vim.api.nvim_buf_del_extmark(bufnr, ns_id, _G.current_extmark_id)
  _G.current_extmark_id = nil
  _G.current_suggestion = nil

  -- Trigger a new suggestion
  vim.schedule(_G.suggest) -- Call suggest directly, no need for an anonymous function
end

-- ... (rest of the code is the same)
```

Key Change:

* **`vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, current_line, current_line, false, { first_suggestion_line })`**:  This now inserts at the current line, pushing the existing line down.
* **`vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { current_line + 1, #first_suggestion_line })`**: This moves the cursor to the *next* line (`current_line + 1`), which now contains the inserted suggestion.



By making this small adjustment, the accepted suggestion will be inserted below the cursor's current line, maintaining consistency with the behavior of `_G.accept_the_whole_suggestion()`.  I've also directly called `_G.suggest` using its global name and used `vim.schedule` to avoid the "recursive lua call" warning.  No changes are needed in `lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`.
