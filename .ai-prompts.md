# Consider error message as a suggestion, if any

In `./plugin/init.lua`, the function   `process_deepseek_response()` is called when the DeepSeek API returns a response.

If the response code is 200, it performes the suggestion insertion in the buffer.
For other response codes, it logs the error messages and does nothing more.

For 200 to 599 response codes, the error message is in `body.choices[1].message.content` , it is the same JSON path when success and failure.

I want that for 400 to 599 response codes also, the error messages are logged and also inserted as suggestions in the buffer.

Tell me the modifications I have to make to get the error messages logged and also inserted as suggestions in the buffer.
