# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be a code completion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Suggest a completion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode, if I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
then the plugin should suggest to complete the current word with a random sentence 
picked from the list of sentences. The suggestion text should appear in grey.

The problem is when I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>` just after entering INSERT mode, nothing is suggested.

I have to write one first, then press `<M-PageDown>` to see the suggestion.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to get the suggestion just after entering INSERT mode.
