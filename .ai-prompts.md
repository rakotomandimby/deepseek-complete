# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be a code completion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.

That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Suggest a completion from a random sentence when triggered.

I want that when I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode, if I issue the key sequence `<C-c>`,
then the plugin should suggest to complete the current word with a random sentence picked from the list of sentences. The suggestion text must appear in grey.

Tell me what code to put in what file in order to achieve that.
