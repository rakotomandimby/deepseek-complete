# Accept the first line of the suggestion and triger again

There is a keymap and a function to accept the whole suggestion: `_G.accept_the_whole_suggestion`.

I want to accept the first line of the suggestion with a keymap `<M-Down>`.
I also want that when I accept the first line, the remaining suggestions lines are discarded and another suggestion is triggered based on that accepted line.

Tell me what I need to change in the code to achieve what I want.

# `M.get_buffer_content` is not returning anything

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, I want to get the content of a given buffer.
But my function `M.get_buffer_content` is not returning anything.

Analyze the code and tell me what I need to change to get the content of a given buffer.
