# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement everything in one step, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).
- Get the content of the current buffer know how to split it into 2 parts: 
    - the first part is the text from the begining of the buffer to the cursor position
    - the second part is the text from the cursor position to the end of the buffer
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.
If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion disappears.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears, again and again.

That is the desired behavior.

## Step 3: Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).

Now the current code allows to transform the inline suggestion into regular text with the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence.

## Step 4: Get the text before and after the cursor then log it into the logs

Logging is achieved with the following code:

```
local rktmb_deepseek_complete = require("rktmb-deepseek-complete")
rktmb-deepseek-complete.log("The text to log")
```

When in INSERT mode and issue the `<M-PageDown>` key sequence, I want to add the feature to:
- put the cursor at the end of the line
- get the content from the beginning of the line to the cursor position and store it in a variable
- get the content from the cursor position to the end of the buffer and store it in a variable
- log the 2 variables into the logs

The features that already work must continue to work.

Tell me the modifications I need to make to the code in order to achieve what I want.

## Unpack is deprecated

The `unpack()` function used in `./plugin/init.lua` is deprecated in Lua 5.4.
I tried to use `table.unpack()` instead, but it breaks the code.

```
E5108: Error executing lua ....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:10: attempt to call field 'unpack' (a nil value)
stack traceback:
        ....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:10: in function 'suggest_random_sentence'
        [string ":lua"]:1: in main chunk
```

Tell me what I need to change in the code to make it compatible with Lua 5.4.
