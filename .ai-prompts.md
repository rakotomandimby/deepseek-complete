# Get the list of opened buffers

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, I want a function that lists open buffers, ordered by most recent visited.

Tell me the code for that.

# Invalid option name "changedtick"

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, I want to sort the list of buffers by most recently visited.
But my code uses `changedtick` to detect the most recently visited buffer.
Maybe I should use `lastused` instead?

Tell what changes I need to make to `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` to achieve what I want.

# Make keymaps configurable

I install the plugin with this code:

```lua
{
    "rktmb/rktmb-deepseek-complete.nvim",
}
```

I want the users to be able to configure the keymaps.
Currently, the keymaps are hardcoded in `./plugin/init.lua`.

Propose me the modifications to `./plugin/init.lua` to allow users to configure the keymaps but keep the current behavior if they don't configure anything.
