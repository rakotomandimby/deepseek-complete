# Get the content of the line the cursor is on

In `./plugin/init.lua`, there is a local variable `line_the_cursor_is_on` that is supposed to store the content of the line the cursor is on.
The problem is that the variable is empty.

Analyze the code and tell me what I need to change to get the content of the line the cursor is on in the variable `line_the_cursor_is_on`.
