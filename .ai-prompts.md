# Implement the "finish the sentence" feature

The "finish the sentence" feature uses the DeepSeek API to complete the current sentence.

- The user types letters in the current buffer.
- The suggestion is triggered by the user typing letters, spaces, or punctuation marks.
- The suggestion is appended to the current line the cursor is on.
- The user can accept the suggestion by pressing the `<M-Right>` key.
- If the user continues typing letters, the must be updated by querying the DeepSeek API.

This feature is different from the current one as:
- The current one is triggered by issuing a keymap: `<M-ESC>`. The "finish the sentence" feature is triggered by typing letters, spaces, or punctuation marks.
- The current feature suggests whole lines and suggestions are placed below the current line. The "finish the sentence" feature suggests the continuation of the current line and suggestions are placed at the end of the current line.


We will keep the current feature working and ADD the "finish the sentence" feature to the code.
