# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

The suggestion is triggered each time the user type the space key.
When the user types fast, the suggestion is triggered only if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types, the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
But as far as the user types, the suggestion must be cleared.

If a new suggestion comes, the old suggestion must be cleared.

IF the user continues typing, the suggestion must be cleared and the new suggestion will be displayed when it arrives.

This behaviour must be repeatable any time the user types.

Tell me the modifications I need to make to the code in order to achieve that.
