# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement everything in one step, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).
- Get the content of the current buffer know how to split it into 2 parts: 
    - the first part is the text from the begining of the buffer to the cursor position
    - the second part is the text from the cursor position to the end of the buffer
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.
If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion disappears.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears, again and again.

That is the desired behavior.

## Step 3: Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).

Now the current code allows to transform the inline suggestion into regular text with the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence.

## Step 4: Get the text before and after the cursor then log it into the logs

When in INSERT mode and issue the `<M-PageDown>` key sequence:
- the cursor goes the end of the current line
- the content from the beginning of the line to the cursor position is stored in a variable
- the content from the cursor position to the end of the buffer is stored in a variable
- the logs confirms the 2 variables has the correct content

That is the desired behavior. Let's continue to implement the remaining steps without breaking the current features.

## Step 5: Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.

According to the DeepSeek API documentation, the API expects a POST request with the following body:

```
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.deepseek.com/beta/completions' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data-raw '{
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "prompt": <text_before_cursor>,
  "echo": false,
  "frequency_penalty": 0,
  "logprobs": 0,
  "max_tokens":131072 ,
  "presence_penalty": 0,
  "stop": ["```"],
  "stream": false,
  "stream_options": null,
  "suffix": <text_after_cursor>,
  "temperature": 1,
  "top_p": 1
}'
```

I want to use "plenary.nvim" to make the HTTP requests.
For the moment, I want to log the DeepSeek API response into the logs.
I want to DeepSeek API request to be made just after `text_before_cursor` and `text_after_cursor` are defined.

Propose me the modifications to `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve what I want.
