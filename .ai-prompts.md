# Get the list of opened buffers

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, I want a function that lists open buffers, ordered by most recent visited.

Tell me the code for that.

# Invalid option name "changedtick"

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, I want to sort the list of buffers by most recently visited.
But my code uses `changedtick` to detect the most recently visited buffer.
Maybe I should use `lastused` instead?

Tell what changes I need to make to `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` to achieve what I want.
