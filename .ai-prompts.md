# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be a code completion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Suggest a completion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode, if I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
then the plugin should suggest to complete the current word with a random sentence picked from the list of sentences. The suggestion text must appear in grey.

The problem is that I get the following error when I issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>` in insert mode:

```
E5108: Error executing lua: Vim:E565: Not allowed to change text or change window
stack traceback:
        [C]: in function 'complete'
        ....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:14: 
in function <....local/share/nvim/lazy/deepseek-complete/plugin/init.lua:7>
```

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to fix the problem.
