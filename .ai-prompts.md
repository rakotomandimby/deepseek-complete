# Propose completion from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go.
We are to make it step by step.

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a random sentence.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
the plugin suggests with a random sentence picked from the list of sentences. 
The suggestion text appears in grey.

If I leave the INSERT mode, the suggestion is removed.

After the suggestion is displayed, if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears the same way as it does when I leave the INSERT mode.

That is good.

But if I re-continue to type then re-trigger the completion, the suggestion is not removed anymore. The "erase-if-I-type" only works once.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion disappear if I continue to type over it any number of times.
