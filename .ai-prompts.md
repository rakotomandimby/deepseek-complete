# Propose inline suggestions from the random sentence generator

The final goal of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest.
But we are not going to implement all in one go, we are to make it step by step.

- Generate random sentences
- Make an inline suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.
- Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).
- Query the DeepSeek API to get suggestions from the content of the buffer.
- Use the DeepSeek API response to suggest completions (dont use the random sentences anymore)

## Step 1: Generate a random sentence

in `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua`, there is a function called `generate_sentence()`.
That function generates a multiline random sentence.
This is done.

## Step 2: Make an inline  suggestion from a random sentence when triggered.

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.
If I continue to type after the suggestion is displayed, the suggestion disappears.
As far as I type, I can trigger the suggestion again and if I continue to type, the suggestion disappears, again and again.

That is the desired behavior.

## Step 3: Have the possibility transform the inline suggestion into regular text (accepting the suggestion).

When I am in a buffer and in INSERT mode and issue the key sequence `<M-PageDown>`,
The plugin to place de cursor at the end of the line and then insert an inline suggestion 
taken from a random sentence (which is multi line) picked from the list of sentences.
The suggestion appears in grey (#808080).
The suggestion pushes down the lines below it and does not overlap with the text below.

I want to transform the inline suggestion into regular text because I like that suggested sentence.
I want that if I issue the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence, the suggestion is transformed into regular text.

Analyze the code and tell me what should I do to make the inline suggestion to be transformed into regular text with the `<M-PageUp>` key sequence.
