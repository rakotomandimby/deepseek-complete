# Propose inline suggestions from DeepSeek API

The final purpose of this project is to be an inline suggestion plugin that uses the DeepSeek API to suggest completions.

I already have some pieces of code.
I need you to generate the missing parts.

## Step 1: Get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor

The cursor position is a tuple of (row, column), where row is the line number and column is the character position within the line.
The code to get the text from the beginning of the current buffer to the cursor is `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` function `M.get_text_before_cursor()`.

## Step 2: Get the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer

In `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` I created the function `M.get_text_after_cursor()` 
that returns the text from the cursor to the end of the current buffer.

## Step 3: Query the DeepSeek API

When the user presses `<M-ESC>`, the function `suggest()` is called. That is the behavior I want.
Also, now, if in INSERT mode and the user presses the space key, `suggest()` is called.

That is the behavior I want.

## Step 4: Insert the suggestion as extmark

Now the suggestion returned by the DeepSeek API is inserted as an extmark.
The extmark starts after the cursor position, NOT at the end of the line.
The suggestion first line is displayed on the same line as the cursor and the remaining lines are displayed below the cursor, 
pushing down the text below the cursor.

That is the expected behavior.

## Step 5: Avoid trigerring the suggestion too often

When the user types fast, the suggestion may only be triggered if the last HTTP response has been received for more than 1 second.
That is the behavior I want.

## Step 6: Clear the suggestion when the user types.

As the user types `<M-ESC>` key, a suggestion is triggered and the suggestion is displayed as an extmark.
If the user continues typing, the suggestion is cleared.
If the types `<M-ESC>` key again, the suggestion is triggered and the new suggestion is displayed when it arrives.
This is repeatable any number of times.

This is the behavior I want.

## Step 7: accept the suggestion word by word

When a suggestion is displayed, I want the user to be able to accept it word by word with the `<M-Right>` key.
So, as far as there is a suggestion, if the user presses `<M-Right>`, 
the first word of the suggestion is accepted and transformed into text at the same position.

Tell me the modifications I need to make in order to achieve that.
