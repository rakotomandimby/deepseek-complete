# Accept the first line of the suggestion and triger again

There is a keymap and a function to accept the first line of a suggestion: `_G.accept_one_suggestion_line()`.

It accepts the first line of the suggestion with the keymap `<M-Down>`.
When I accept the first line, the remaining suggestions lines are discarded and another suggestion is triggered based on that accepted line.

The problem is the accepted line goes one line above the current line of the cursor. I do not have that problem with the `_G.accept_the_whole_suggestion()` function.

Analyze the code, compare the functions and tell me the modifications I have to make to get the accepted line below the line of the cursor.
