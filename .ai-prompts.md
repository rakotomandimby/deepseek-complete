# Remove the last line of `text_before_cursor`.

In `./plugin/init.lua`, there is a local variable `text_before_cursor` that is supposed to store the content of the buffer from the beginning of the buffer to the cursor position.

I need to remove the last line of `text_before_cursor` because the last line is not part of the context.
Propose me the modifications to `./plugin/init.lua` to achieve what I want.

# Remove the markdown delimiters function

`rktmb_deepseek_complete.remove_markdown_start_code_block_delimiter(suggestion)` and `rktmb_deepseek_complete.remove_markdown_end_code_block_delimiter(suggestion)` are functions that remove the markdown delimiters.

These are separated, and it would be cleaner to merge them into a single function.

Propose me the modifications to `./lua/rktmb-deepseek-complete.lua` to have one `remove_markdown_delimiters` and tell me where I should change the calls.
